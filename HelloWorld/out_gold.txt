Mr. PERSON

said O
very O
little O

Mr. PERSON

nothing O

The O

divided O

admiration O

well O
enough O

glad O

The O
apothecary O
came O

having O
examined O
his O
patient O

as O

violent O
cold O

that O

must O
endeavor O

get O
the O
better O

it O
; O
advised O
her O
to O
return O
to O
bed O

promised O
her O
some O
draughts O

The O
advice O
was O
followed O
readily O

the O
feverish O

head O
ached O
acutely O

little O

such O
concern O

no O

repeated O
three O

they O
were O
grieved O

how O
shocking O
it O

to O

a O
bad O

how O
excessively O

disliked O

ill O
themselves O

then O
thought O
no O
more O
of O
the O
matter O

their O
indifference O

party O

could O
regard O
with O
any O
complacency O

His O
anxiety O

evident O

his O

very O

she O
had O
no O

She O
could O
only O
imagine O

at O

his O

rather O
expected O
to O
affront O
him O

was O
amazed O
at O
his O
gallantry O

but O
there O
was O
a O
mixture O
of O
sweetness O

archness O

her O
manner O

made O
it O
difficult O

never O

anxiety O

something O

made O
her O

diffuseness O

warmth O
remained O
for O

salutation O

He O
was O
full O
of O
joy O

attention O

The O
first O
half-hour O
was O
spent O
in O
piling O
up O
the O
fire O

lest O

suffer O
from O
the O
change O

she O
removed O
at O
his O
desire O

side O

the O

might O
be O
further O

sat O
down O

over O

Mr. PERSON

reminded O

his O

assured O

the O
silence O

nothing O

to O
stretch O
himself O

up O

the O
attempt O

be O
amused O
with O
her O

gave O
a O

yawn O

are O
the O
kind O
of O

Mrs. PERSON

was O
quite O
awed O
by O
such O
an O
excess O

her O
contemplation O

soon O
put O

an O
end O

exclamations O

up O

down O

unluckily O
no O

a O

of O

, O
in O

a O
little O

cheering O

Mr. PERSON

repeated O
his O

daughter O

elegant O

not O

even O
pointedly O
included O
him O
in O

for O
the O
next O
evening O

utterly O
unknown O
to O

before O

supposed O

might O
be O
attributed O
to O
his O

him O

five O

suitable O
hour O

Meryton LOCATION

the O

the O
pleasure O

that O

at O
leisure O

he O
was O
so O
much O
struck O
with O
the O
size O

furniture O
of O
the O
apartment O
, O
that O
he O
declared O
he O
might O
almost O
have O
supposed O
himself O
in O
the O
small O
summer DATE
breakfast O
parlor O
at O
Rosings O
; O
a O
comparison O
that O
did O
not O
at O

when O
Mrs. PERSON

from O

what O
Rosings PERSON

who O

its O
proprietor O

had O
listened O
to O
the O
description O
of O
only O
one O
of O
Lady O
Catherine PERSON

drawing-rooms O
, O
and O
found O
that O
the O
chimney-piece O
alone O
had O
cost O
eight O
hundred O
pounds O
, O
she O
felt O
all O
the O
force O
of O
the O
compliment O
, O

would O
hardly O
have O
resented O
a O
comparison O
with O
the O
housekeeper O

In O
describing O
to O
her O
all O
the O
grandeur O
of O

with O
occasional O
digressions O
in O
praise O
of O
his O

the O
improvements O
it O
was O
receiving O
, O
he O
was O
happily O
employed O
until O
the O
gentlemen O
joined O
them O
; O
and O
he O
found O
in O
Mrs. PERSON
Phillips PERSON
a O
very O
attentive O
listener O
, O
whose O
opinion O
of O
his O
consequence O
increased O
with O
what O
she O
heard O

who O
was O
resolving O
to O
retail O
it O
all O
among O
her O
neighbors O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
could O
. O
To O
the O
girls O
, O
who O
could O
not O
listen O
to O
their O
cousin O

who O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O

to O
wish O
for O
an O
instrument O
, O
and O
examine O
their O
own O
indifferent O
imitations O
of O
china O
on O
the O
mantelpiece O

the O
interval O

waiting O

very O
long O

It O
was O
over O
at O
last O

The O
gentlemen O
did O
approach O
, O

when O
Mr. PERSON

walked O
into O
the O
room O

Elizabeth PERSON

that O

neither O
been O
seeing O
him O
before O

nor O
thinking O
of O
him O
since O
, O
with O
the O
smallest O
degree O
of O
unreasonable O
admiration O

The O
officers O
of O

in O
general O
a O
very O
creditable O

gentlemanlike O
set O

the O
best O
of O

were O
of O

party O

Mr. PERSON

as O
far O
beyond O
them O
all O
in O
person O
, O
countenance O

air O
, O

walk O
, O
as O

were O
superior O

breathing O
port O

who O
followed O

Mr. PERSON

the O
happy O
man O

turned O

Elizabeth PERSON
was O
the O
happy O
woman O
by O

he O
finally O
seated O
himself O
; O

the O
agreeable O
manner O
in O
which O
he O
immediately O
fell O
into O
conversation O
, O
though O
it O
was O
only O
on O
its O
being O
a O
wet O
night O

made O
her O
feel O
that O
the O
commonest O

dullest O
, O
most O
threadbare O
topic O
might O
be O
rendered O
interesting O
by O
the O
skill O

such O

for O
the O
notice O
of O
the O
fair O
as O
Mr. PERSON
Wickham PERSON

the O
officers O
, O
Mr. PERSON

seemed O
to O
sink O
into O
insignificance O
; O
to O
the O
young O
ladies O
he O
certainly O
was O
nothing O
; O
but O
he O
had O
still O
at O
intervals O
a O
kind O
listener O
in O
Mrs. PERSON
Phillips PERSON
, O
and O
was O
by O
her O
watchfulness O
, O
most O
abundantly O
supplied O
with O
coffee O
and O
muffin O
. O
When O
the O
card-tables O
were O
placed O

he O
had O
the O
opportunity O

obliging O

turn O

by O
sitting O
down O
to O
whist O

`` O

Mr. PERSON

not O
play O

with O
ready O
delight O
was O
he O
received O
at O
the O

table O
between O

At O
first O
there O
seemed O
danger O
of O

engrossing O
him O
entirely O
, O
for O
she O
was O
a O
most O
determined O
talker O

but O
being O
likewise O
extremely O
fond O
of O

, O
she O
soon O
grew O

much O
interested O

too O
eager O
in O
making O
bets O

exclaiming O

at O

willing O

the O

the O

inquired O
how O
far O

from O

, O
after O

asked O

Chapter O

Till O
Elizabeth PERSON
entered O
the O
drawing-room O
at O
Netherfield LOCATION
, O
and O
looked O
in O
vain O
for O
Mr. PERSON
Wickham PERSON
among O
the O
cluster O
of O

coats O
there O
assembled O
, O
a O
doubt O
of O
his O

to O

The O

checked O
by O
any O
of O
those O
recollections O
that O
might O
not O

alarmed O
her O

She O
had O
dressed O
with O
more O
than O
usual O
care O
, O
and O
prepared O
in O
the O
highest O
spirits O
for O
the O
conquest O
of O
all O
that O
remained O
unsubdued O
of O
his O
heart O
, O
trusting O
that O
it O
was O
not O
more O
than O
might O
be O
won O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
evening TIME
. O
But O
in O
an O
instant O
arose O
the O
dreadful O
suspicion O
of O
his O
being O
purposely O
omitted O
for O
Mr. PERSON
Darcy PERSON

pleasure O
in O
the O
Bingleys O

this O

the O
absolute O
fact O
of O

was O
pronounced O
by O
his O
friend O

to O

eagerly O
applied O

go O
to O

on O
business O
the O
day O
before O

This O
part O

caught O
by O
Elizabeth LOCATION

and O
, O
as O
it O
assured O
her O
that O

not O
less O
answerable O
for O

absence O
than O
if O
her O
first O
surmise O
had O
been O
just O

every O
feeling O
of O
displeasure O
against O
the O

so O
sharpened O
by O

was O
resolved O
against O
any O

of O
conversation O
with O
him O

turned O
away O
with O
a O
degree O
of O
ill-humour O

she O
could O
not O
wholly O
surmount O
even O
in O
speaking O
to O
Mr. PERSON
Bingley PERSON
, O
whose O
blind O
partiality O
provoked O
her O

But O
Elizabeth PERSON
was O
not O
formed O
for O
ill-humour O
; O
and O
though O
every O
prospect O
of O
her O
own O
was O
destroyed O
for O
the O
evening O

it O
could O
not O
dwell O
long O
on O

the O
oddities O

him O
out O
to O
her O

notice O

The O
first O
two O
dances O
, O
however O
, O
brought O
a O
return O
of O
distress O
; O
they O
were O
dances O
of O
mortification O
. O
Mr. PERSON
Collins PERSON
, O
awkward O

solemn O
, O
apologising O
instead O
of O
attending O
, O
and O
often O
moving O
wrong O
without O
being O
aware O
of O
it O
, O
gave O
her O
all O
the O
shame O
and O
misery O
which O
a O
disagreeable O
partner O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
dances O
can O
give O
. O
The O
moment O
of O
her O
release O
from O
him O
was O
ecstasy O
. O
She O
danced O
next O
with O
an O
officer O
, O
and O
had O
the O
refreshment O
of O
talking O
of O
Wickham LOCATION

and O
of O
hearing O
that O

was O
universally O
liked O

When O
those O
dances O
were O
over O

she O
returned O
to O
Charlotte LOCATION

in O
conversation O

accepted O
him O

walked O
away O

over O

When O

not O

times O

Elizabeth O
made O
no O

her O
place O

amazed O
at O
the O
dignity O

They O
stood O
for O
some O
time O
without O
speaking O
a O
word O
; O
and O
she O
began O
to O
imagine O
that O
their O
silence O
was O
to O
last O
through O
the O
two O
dances O
, O
and O
at O
first O
was O
resolved O
not O
to O
break O
it O
; O
till O
suddenly O
fancying O
that O
it O
would O
be O
the O
greater O
punishment O
to O
her O

to O
oblige O
him O
to O
talk O

she O
made O
some O
slight O
observation O
on O

replied O

again O
silent O

pause O

observe O
that O

'' O
As O
Elizabeth PERSON
had O
no O
longer O
any O
interest O
of O
her O
own O
to O
pursue O
, O
she O
turned O
her O
attention O
almost O
entirely O
on O
her O
sister O
and O
Mr. PERSON
Bingley PERSON
; O
and O
the O
train O
of O
agreeable O
reflections O
which O
her O
observations O
gave O
birth O
to O
, O
made O
her O
perhaps O
almost O
as O
happy O
as O
Jane PERSON
. O
She O
saw O
her O
in O
idea O
settled O
in O
that O
very O
house O
, O
in O
all O
the O
felicity O
which O
a O
marriage O
of O
true O
affection O
could O
bestow O
; O
and O
she O
felt O
capable O
, O
under O
such O
circumstances O
, O
of O
endeavoring O
even O
to O
like O
Bingley ORGANIZATION
's O
two O
sisters O
. O
Her O
mother O
's O
thoughts O
she O
plainly O
saw O
were O
bent O
the O

way O
, O
and O
she O
determined O
not O
to O
venture O
near O
her O
, O
lest O
she O
might O
hear O
too O
much O
. O
When O
they O
sat O
down O
to O
supper O
, O
therefore O
, O
she O
considered O
it O
a O
most O
unlucky O
perverseness O
which O
placed O
them O
within O
one O
of O
each O
other O
; O
and O
deeply O
was O
she O
vexed O
to O
find O
that O
her O
mother O
was O
talking O
to O
that O
one O
person O
-LRB- O
Lady O
Lucas PERSON
-RRB- O
freely O
, O
openly O
, O
and O
of O
nothing O
else O
but O
her O
expectation O
that O
Jane PERSON
would O
soon O
be O
married O
to O
Mr. PERSON
Bingley PERSON
. O
It O
was O
an O
animating O
subject O
, O
and O
Mrs. PERSON
Bennet PERSON
seemed O
incapable O
of O
fatigue O
while O
enumerating O
the O
advantages O
of O
the O
match O
. O
His O
being O
such O
a O
charming O
young O
man O
, O
and O
so O
rich O
, O
and O
living O
but O
three O
miles O
from O
them O
, O
were O
the O
first O
points O
of O
self-gratulation O
; O
and O
then O
it O
was O
such O
a O
comfort O
to O
think O
how O
fond O
the O
two O
sisters O
were O
of O
Jane PERSON
, O
and O
to O
be O
certain O
that O
they O
must O
desire O
the O
connection O
as O
much O
as O
she O
could O
do O
. O
It O
was O
, O
moreover O
, O
such O
a O
promising O
thing O
for O
her O
younger O
daughters O
, O
as O
Jane PERSON
's O
marrying O
so O
greatly O
must O
throw O
them O
in O
the O
way O
of O
other O
rich O
men O
; O
and O
lastly O
, O
it O
was O
so O
pleasant O
at O
her O
time O
of O
life O
to O
be O
able O
to O
consign O
her O
single O
daughters O
to O
the O
care O
of O
their O
sister O
, O
that O
she O
might O
not O
be O
obliged O
to O
go O
into O
company O
more O
than O
she O
liked O
. O
It O
was O
necessary O
to O
make O
this O
circumstance O
a O
matter O
of O
pleasure O
, O
because O
on O
such O
occasions O
it O
is O
the O
etiquette O
; O
but O
no O
one O
was O
less O
likely O
than O
Mrs. PERSON
Bennet PERSON
to O
find O
comfort O
in O
staying O
home O
at O
any O
period O
of O
her O
life O
. O
She O
concluded O
with O
many O
good O
wishes O
that O
Lady O
Lucas PERSON
might O
soon O
be O
equally O
fortunate O
, O
though O
evidently O
and O
triumphantly O
believing O
there O
was O
no O
chance O
of O
it O
. O
In O
vain O
did O
Elizabeth PERSON
endeavor O
to O
check O
the O
rapidity O
of O
her O
mother O
's O
words O
, O
or O
persuade O
her O
to O
describe O
her O
felicity O
in O
a O
less O
audible O
whisper O
; O
for O
, O
to O
her O
inexpressible O
vexation O
, O
she O
could O
perceive O
that O
the O
chief O
of O
it O
was O
overheard O
by O
Mr. PERSON
Darcy PERSON
, O
who O
sat O
opposite O
to O
them O
. O
Her O
mother O
only O
scolded O
her O
for O
being O
nonsensical O

`` O

Nothing O

any O

Her O
mother O
would O
talk O
of O
her O
views O
in O
the O
same O
intelligible O
tone O
. O
Elizabeth O
blushed O
and O
blushed O
again O
with O
shame O
and O
vexation O
. O
She O
could O
not O
help O
frequently O
glancing O
her O
eye O
at O
Mr. PERSON
Darcy PERSON
, O
though O
every O
glance O
convinced O
her O
of O
what O
she O
dreaded O
; O
for O
though O
he O
was O
not O
always O
looking O
at O
her O
mother O
, O
she O
was O
convinced O
that O
his O
attention O
was O
invariably O
fixed O
by O
her O
. O
The O
expression O
of O
his O
face O
changed O
gradually O
from O
indignant O
contempt O
to O
a O
composed O
and O
steady O
gravity O
. O
At O
length O
, O
however O
, O
Mrs. PERSON
Bennet PERSON
had O
no O
more O
to O
say O
; O
and O
Lady PERSON
Lucas PERSON

who O
had O
been O
long O
yawning O
at O
the O
repetition O
of O
delights O
which O
she O
saw O
no O
likelihood O
of O
sharing O

left O
to O
the O
comforts O

Elizabeth O
now O
began O

not O
long O

the O
interval O

tranquillity O
; O
for O
, O
when O
supper O

over O

singing O

she O
had O
the O
mortification O
of O
seeing O
Mary PERSON

after O
very O
little O
entreaty O
, O
preparing O
to O
oblige O
the O
company O

By O
many O
significant O
looks O

silent O
entreaties O

did O
she O
endeavor O
to O
prevent O
such O
a O
proof O
of O
complaisance O
, O
but O
in O
vain O
; O
Mary PERSON
would O
not O
understand O
them O
; O
such O
an O
opportunity O
of O
exhibiting O
was O
delightful O
to O
her O
, O
and O
she O
began O
her O
song O
. O
Elizabeth O
's O
eyes O
were O
fixed O
on O
her O
with O
most O
painful O
sensations O
, O
and O
she O
watched O
her O
progress O
through O
the O
several O
stanzas O
with O
an O
impatience O
which O
was O
very O
ill O
rewarded O
at O
their O
close O
; O
for O
Mary ORGANIZATION
, O
on O
receiving O

the O
thanks O

the O
hint O

prevailed O
on O
to O

them O
again O

after O
the O
pause O
of O
half O
a O
minute O
began O
another O
. O
Mary O
's O
powers O
were O
by O
no O
means O
fitted O
for O
such O
a O
display O
; O
her O
voice O
was O
weak O

and O
her O
manner O

Elizabeth O
was O
in O
agonies O

She O
looked O
at O

how O

bore O
it O

very O
composedly O
talking O

She O
looked O
at O
his O

derision O

sure O

in O

I O
consider O

a O
very O
innocent O

perfectly O
compatible O

rector O

may O

beneficial O

himself O

must O
write O

the O
time O

which O
he O
can O
not O
be O
excused O
from O
making O
as O
comfortable O
as O
possible O

I O
do O
not O

it O
of O
light O
importance O

an O
agreement O

they O
could O

Mr. PERSON

however O

have O
such O
an O
opportunity O

ridiculing O

bad O
enough O

the O

The O
rest O

her O
little O
amusement O

was O
teased O

dance O

put O
it O
out O

power O

offer O
to O
introduce O
him O
to O
any O
young O

He O
assured O
her O
, O
that O
as O
to O
dancing O

he O
was O
perfectly O
indifferent O

it O

that O
his O
chief O
object O
was O
by O
delicate O
attentions O

recommend O
himself O

that O
he O
should O

make O
a O
point O

close O

her O
the O
whole O
evening O

There O
was O
no O
arguing O

relief O

repulsed O
every O

languor O

with O

My O
reasons O

thirdly O

very O
noble O

honor O

opinion O

very O
Saturday DATE
night TIME
before O

left O
Hunsford O

between O

at O
quadrille O

a O

for O

able O
to O
make O
a O
small O
income O
go O
a O
good O
way O

This O
is O
my O
advice O

Find O
such O
a O
woman O
as O
soon O
as O
you O
can O
, O
bring O
her O
to O
Hunsford O
, O
and O
I O
will O
visit O
her O

' O
Allow O
me O

by O
the O
way O

to O
observe O
, O
my O
fair O
cousin O
, O
that O
I O
do O
not O
reckon O
the O
notice O

kindness O
of O
Lady O
Catherine PERSON

Bourgh PERSON
as O
among O
the O
least O
of O
the O
advantages O
in O
my O
power O
to O
offer O
. O
You O
will O
find O
her O
manners O
beyond O
anything O
I O
can O
describe O
; O
and O
your O
wit O
and O
vivacity O
, O
I O
think O
, O
must O
be O
acceptable O
to O
her O
, O
especially O
when O
tempered O
with O
the O
silence O
and O
respect O
which O
her O
rank O
will O
inevitably O
excite O
. O
Thus O
much O
for O
my O
general O
intention O
in O
favor O
of O
matrimony O
; O
it O
remains O
to O
be O
told O
why O
my O
views O
were O
directed O
towards O
Longbourn O
instead O
of O
my O
own O
neighborhood O
, O
where O
I O
can O
assure O
you O
there O
are O
many O
amiable O
young O
women O
. O
But O
the O
fact O
is O
, O
that O
being O
, O
as O
I O
am O
, O
to O
inherit O
this O
estate O
after O
the O
death O
of O
your O
honored O
father O

who O
, O
however O
, O
may O
live O
many O
years O
longer O
-RRB- O
, O
I O
could O
not O
satisfy O
myself O
without O
resolving O
to O
choose O
a O
wife O
from O
among O
his O
daughters O
, O
that O
the O
loss O
to O
them O
might O
be O
as O
little O
as O
possible O
, O
when O
the O
melancholy O
event O
takes O
place O
-- O
which O
, O
however O
, O
as O
I O
have O
already O
said O
, O
may O
not O
be O
for O
several O
years O

This O
has O
been O
my O
motive O

my O
fair O
cousin O

and O
I O
flatter O
myself O
it O
will O
not O
sink O
me O
in O
your O
esteem O

And O
now O
nothing O
remains O
for O
me O

to O
assure O
you O
in O
the O
most O
animated O
language O
of O
the O
violence O
of O
my O
affection O

perfectly O
indifferent O

shall O
make O
no O

I O
am O
well O
aware O
that O
it O

is O
all O
that O
you O

ever O

On O
that O
head O

I O
shall O
be O
uniformly O
silent O

you O
may O
assure O
yourself O
that O
no O

ever O
pass O

the O

for O

his O

expressed O

not O
by O
embarrassment O

by O

by O
stiffness O

scarcely O

to O

the O

a O
double O

she O
felt O
all O
the O

putting O

tried O
to O
join O

her O
usual O
cheerfulness O

the O

Elizabeth PERSON
felt O
an O
anxiety O
on O

drew O
off O

no O

read O

treated O
with O
the O

appeared O
to O

the O

agreed O

even O
this O

gave O
her O
a O

Mr. PERSON

to O
be O
sure O

was O
neither O

his O

irksome O

his O
attachment O

be O
imaginary O

still O
he O
would O
be O
her O
husband O

Without O

highly O
either O
of O

matrimony O

marriage O

always O

object O

it O

all O

least O
agreeable O

blame O

her O

drop O
no O

promise O

dutifully O
given O

it O

forth O
in O
such O
very O
direct O
questions O
on O
his O

required O
some O
ingenuity O
to O
evade O

he O
was O
at O
the O

time O
exercising O
great O
self-denial O
, O
for O
he O
was O
longing O
to O
publish O
his O
prosperous O
love O

As O
he O
was O
to O
begin O
his O
journey O

early O

with O
great O
politeness O

him O
at O

again O

engagements O
might O
allow O
him O
to O

`` O

accept O
him O
. O
She O
rated O
his O
abilities O
much O
higher O
than O
any O
of O
the O
others O
; O
there O
was O
a O
solidity O
in O
his O
reflections O
which O
often O
struck O
her O
, O
and O
though O
by O
no O
means O
so O
clever O
as O
herself O
, O
she O
thought O
that O
if O
encouraged O
to O
read O
and O
improve O
himself O
by O
such O
an O
example O
as O
hers O
, O
he O
might O
become O
a O
very O
agreeable O
companion O
. O
But O
on O
the O
following O
morning O
, O
every O
hope O
of O
this O
kind O
was O
done O
away O
. O
Miss O
Lucas PERSON
called O
soon O
after O
breakfast O
, O
and O
in O
a O
private O
conference O
with O
Elizabeth PERSON
related O
the O
event O
of O
the O
day O
before O
. O
The O
possibility O
of O
Mr. PERSON
Collins PERSON
's O
fancying O
himself O
in O
love O
with O
her O
friend O
had O
once O
occurred O
to O
Elizabeth LOCATION
within O
the O
last DATE
day DATE
or O
two O
; O
but O
that O
Charlotte LOCATION
could O
encourage O
him O
seemed O
almost O
as O
far O
from O
possibility O
as O
she O
could O
encourage O
him O
herself O
, O
and O
her O
astonishment O
was O
consequently O
so O
great O
as O
to O
overcome O
at O
first O
the O
bounds O
of O
decorum O
, O
and O
she O
could O
not O
help O
crying O
out O
: O
`` O
Engaged O
to O
Mr. PERSON
Collins PERSON
! O
My O
dear O
Charlotte LOCATION
-- O
impossible O
! O
'' O
The O
steady O
countenance O
which O
Miss PERSON
Lucas PERSON
had O
commanded O
in O
telling O
her O
story O
, O
gave O
way O
to O
a O
momentary O
confusion O
here O
on O
receiving O
so O
direct O
a O
reproach O
; O
though O
, O
as O
it O
was O
no O
more O
than O
she O
expected O
, O
she O
soon O
regained O
her O
composure O
, O
and O
calmly O
replied O
: O
`` O
Why O
should O
you O
be O
surprised O
, O
my O
dear O
Eliza O
? O
Do O
you O
think O
it O
incredible O
that O
Mr. PERSON
Collins PERSON
should O
be O
able O
to O
procure O
any O
woman O
's O
good O
opinion O
, O
because O
he O
was O
not O
so O
happy O
as O
to O
succeed O
with O
you O
? O
'' O
But O
Elizabeth PERSON
had O
now O
recollected O
herself O
, O
and O
making O
a O
strong O
effort O
for O
it O
, O
was O
able O
to O
assure O
with O
tolerable O
firmness O
that O
the O
prospect O
of O
their O
relationship O
was O
highly O
grateful O
to O
her O
, O
and O
that O
she O
wished O
her O
all O
imaginable O
happiness O
. O
`` O
I O
see O
what O
you O
are O
feeling O
, O
'' O
replied O
Charlotte LOCATION
. O
`` O
You O
must O
be O
surprised O
, O
very O
much O
surprised O
-- O
so O
lately O
as O
Mr. PERSON
Collins PERSON
was O
wishing O
to O
marry O
you O
. O
But O
when O
you O
have O
had O
time O
to O
think O
it O
over O
, O
I O
hope O
you O
will O
be O
satisfied O
with O
what O
I O
have O
done O
. O
I O
am O
not O
romantic O
, O
you O
know O
; O
I O
never O
was O
. O
I O
ask O
only O
a O
comfortable O
home O
; O
and O
considering O
Mr. PERSON
Collins PERSON
's O
character O
, O
connection O
, O
and O
situation O
in O
life O
, O
I O
am O
convinced O
that O
my O
chance O
of O
happiness O
with O
him O
is O
as O
fair O
as O
most O
people O
can O
boast O
on O
entering O
the O
marriage O
state O
. O
'' O
Elizabeth O
quietly O
answered O
`` O
Undoubtedly O
; O
'' O
and O
after O
an O
awkward O
pause O
, O
they O
returned O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
family O
. O
Charlotte O
did O
not O
stay O
much O
longer O
, O
and O
Elizabeth PERSON
was O
then O
left O
to O
reflect O
on O
what O
she O
had O
heard O
. O
It O
was O
a O
long O
time O
before O
she O
became O
at O
all O
reconciled O
to O
the O
idea O
of O
so O
unsuitable O
a O
match O
. O
The O
strangeness O
of O
Mr. PERSON
Collins PERSON
's O
making O
two O
offers O
of O
marriage O
within O
three O
days O
was O
nothing O
in O
comparison O
of O
his O
being O
now O
accepted O
. O
She O
had O
always O
felt O
that O
Charlotte LOCATION
's O
opinion O
of O
matrimony O
was O
not O
exactly O
like O
her O
own O
, O
but O
she O
had O
not O
supposed O
it O
to O
be O
possible O
that O
, O
when O
called O
into O
action O
, O
she O
would O
have O
sacrificed O
every O
better O
feeling O
to O
worldly O
advantage O
. O
Charlotte O
the O
wife O
of O
Mr. PERSON
Collins PERSON
was O
a O
most O
humiliating O
picture O
! O
And O
to O
the O
pang O
of O
a O
friend O
disgracing O
herself O
and O
sunk O
in O
her O
esteem O
, O
was O
added O
the O
distressing O
conviction O
that O
it O
was O
impossible O
for O
that O
friend O
to O
be O
tolerably O
happy O
in O
the O
lot O
she O
had O
chosen O
. O
Chapter O
23 O
Elizabeth PERSON
was O
sitting O
with O
her O
mother O
and O
sisters O
, O
reflecting O
on O
what O
she O
had O
heard O
, O
and O
doubting O
whether O
she O
was O
authorised O
to O
mention O
it O
, O
when O
Sir O
William PERSON
Lucas PERSON
himself O
appeared O
, O
sent O
by O
his O
daughter O
, O
to O
announce O
her O
engagement O
to O
the O
family O

With O
many O
compliments O
to O
them O
, O
and O
much O
self-gratulation O
on O
the O
prospect O
of O
a O
connection O
between O
the O
houses O
, O
he O
unfolded O
the O
matter O
-- O
to O
an O
audience O
not O
merely O
wondering O
, O
but O
incredulous O
; O
for O
Mrs. PERSON
Bennet PERSON
, O
with O
more O
perseverance O
than O
politeness O
, O
protested O
he O
must O
be O
entirely O
mistaken O
; O
and O
Lydia PERSON
, O
always O
unguarded O
and O
often O
uncivil O
, O
boisterously O
exclaimed O
: O
`` O
Good O
Lord O
! O
Sir O
William PERSON
, O
how O
can O
you O
tell O
such O
a O
story O
? O
Do O
not O
you O
know O
that O
Mr. PERSON
Collins PERSON
wants O
to O
marry O
Lizzy O
? O
'' O
Nothing O
less O
than O
the O
complaisance O
of O
a O
courtier O
could O
have O
borne O
without O
anger O
such O
treatment O
; O
but O
Sir O
William PERSON
's O
good O
breeding O
carried O
him O
through O
it O
all O
; O
and O
though O
he O
begged O
leave O
to O
be O
positive O
as O
to O
the O
truth O
of O
his O
information O
, O
he O
listened O
to O
all O
their O
impertinence O
with O
the O
most O
forbearing O
courtesy O
. O
Elizabeth O
, O
feeling O
it O
incumbent O
on O
her O
to O
relieve O
him O
from O
so O
unpleasant O
a O
situation O
, O
now O
put O
herself O
forward O
to O
confirm O
his O
account O
, O
by O
mentioning O
her O
prior O
knowledge O
of O
it O
from O
Charlotte LOCATION
herself O
; O
and O
endeavored O
to O
put O
a O
stop O
to O
the O
exclamations O
of O
her O
mother O
and O
sisters O
by O
the O
earnestness O
of O
her O
congratulations O
to O
Sir O
William PERSON
, O
in O
which O
she O
was O
readily O
joined O
by O
Jane PERSON
, O
and O
by O
making O
a O
variety O
of O
remarks O
on O
the O
happiness O
that O
might O
be O
expected O
from O
the O
match O
, O
the O
excellent O
character O
of O
Mr. PERSON
Collins PERSON
, O
and O
the O
convenient O
distance O
of O
Hunsford O
from O
London LOCATION
. O
Mrs. PERSON
Bennet PERSON
was O
in O
fact O
too O
much O
overpowered O
to O
say O
a O
great O
deal O
while O
Sir O
William PERSON
remained O
; O
but O
no O
sooner O
had O
he O
left O
them O
than O
her O
feelings O
found O
a O
rapid O
vent O
. O
In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
she O
persisted O
in O
disbelieving O
the O
whole O
of O
the O
matter O
; O
secondly O
, O
she O
was O
very O
sure O
that O
Mr. PERSON
Collins PERSON
had O
been O
taken O
in O
; O
thirdly O
, O
she O
trusted O
that O
they O
would O
never O
be O
happy O
together O
; O
and O
fourthly O
, O
that O
the O
match O
might O
be O
broken O
off O
. O
Two O
inferences O
, O
however O
, O
were O
plainly O
deduced O
from O
the O
whole O
: O
one O
, O
that O
Elizabeth PERSON
was O
the O
real O
cause O
of O
the O
mischief O
; O
and O
the O
other O
that O
she O
herself O
had O
been O
barbarously O
misused O
by O
them O
all O
; O
and O
on O
these O
two O
points O
she O
principally O
dwelt O
during O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
day O
. O
Nothing O
could O
console O
and O
nothing O
could O
appease O
her O
. O
Nor O
did O
that O
day O
wear O
out O
her O
resentment O
. O
A O
week O
elapsed O
before O
she O
could O
see O
Elizabeth PERSON
without O
scolding O
her O
, O
a O
month O
passed O
away O
before O
she O
could O
speak O
to O
Sir O
William PERSON
or O
Lady O
Lucas PERSON
without O
being O
rude O
, O
and O
many O
months O
were O
gone O
before O
she O
could O
at O
all O
forgive O
their O
daughter O
. O
Mr. PERSON
Bennet PERSON
's O
emotions O
were O
much O
more O
tranquil O
on O
the O
occasion O
, O
and O
such O
as O
he O
did O
experience O
he O
pronounced O
to O
be O
of O
a O
most O
agreeable O
sort O
; O
for O
it O
gratified O
him O
, O
he O
said O
, O
to O
discover O
that O
Charlotte PERSON
Lucas PERSON
, O
whom O
he O
had O
been O
used O
to O
think O
tolerably O
sensible O
, O
was O
as O
foolish O
as O
his O
wife O
, O
and O
more O
foolish O
than O
his O
daughter O
! O
Jane O
confessed O
herself O
a O
little O
surprised O
at O
the O
match O
; O
but O
she O
said O
less O
of O
her O
astonishment O
than O
of O
her O
earnest O
desire O
for O
their O
happiness O
; O
nor O
could O
Elizabeth PERSON
persuade O
her O
to O
consider O
it O
as O
improbable O

Kitty O

far O
from O
envying O
Miss PERSON
Lucas PERSON

for O
Mr. PERSON
Collins PERSON

only O
a O
clergyman O
; O

it O
affected O
them O
in O
no O
other O
way O

as O
a O
piece O
of O
news O
to O
spread O
at O
Meryton O

Lady O
Lucas PERSON
could O
not O
be O
insensible O
of O
triumph O
on O
being O
able O
to O
retort O
on O
Mrs. PERSON
Bennet PERSON
the O
comfort O
of O
having O
a O
daughter O
well O
married O
; O
and O
she O
called O
at O
Longbourn O
rather O
oftener O
than O
usual O
to O
say O
how O
happy O
she O
was O
, O
though O
Mrs. PERSON
Bennet PERSON
's O
sour O
looks O
and O
ill-natured O
remarks O
might O
have O
been O
enough O
to O
drive O
happiness O
away O

Between O
Elizabeth PERSON
and O
Charlotte LOCATION
there O
was O
a O
restraint O
which O
kept O
them O
mutually O
silent O
on O
the O
subject O
; O
and O
Elizabeth PERSON
felt O
persuaded O
that O
no O
real O
confidence O
could O
ever O
subsist O
between O
them O
again O
. O
Her O
disappointment O
in O
Charlotte LOCATION
made O
her O
turn O
with O
fonder O
regard O
to O
her O
sister O
, O
of O
whose O
rectitude O
and O
delicacy O
she O
was O
sure O
her O
opinion O
could O
never O
be O
shaken O
, O
and O
for O
whose O
happiness O
she O
grew O
daily O
more O
anxious O
, O
as O
Bingley ORGANIZATION
had O
now O
been O
gone O
a O
week O
and O
nothing O
more O
was O
heard O
of O
his O
return O
. O
Jane O
had O
sent O
Caroline PERSON
an O
early O
answer O
to O
her O
letter O

was O
counting O
the O
days O
till O
she O
might O
reasonably O
hope O
to O
hear O
again O

The O
promised O
letter O
of O
thanks O
from O
Mr. PERSON
Collins PERSON
arrived O
on O
Tuesday DATE
, O
addressed O
to O
their O
father O
, O
and O
written O
with O
all O
the O
solemnity O
of O
gratitude O
which O
a O
twelvemonth O
's O
abode O
in O
the O
family O
might O
have O
prompted O
. O
After O
discharging O
his O
conscience O
on O
that O
head O
, O
he O
proceeded O
to O
inform O
them O
, O
with O
many O
rapturous O
expressions O
, O
of O
his O
happiness O
in O
having O
obtained O
the O
affection O
of O
their O
amiable O
neighbor O
, O
Miss PERSON
Lucas PERSON
, O
and O
then O
explained O
that O
it O
was O
merely O
with O
the O
view O
of O
enjoying O
her O
society O
that O
he O
had O
been O
so O
ready O
to O
close O
with O
their O
kind O
wish O

him O
again O
at O

whither O
he O
hoped O
to O
be O
able O
to O
return O
on O
Monday DATE
fortnight O
; O
for O
Lady O
Catherine PERSON
, O
he O
added O
, O
so O
heartily O
approved O
his O
marriage O
, O
that O
she O
wished O
it O
to O
take O
place O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
, O
which O
he O
trusted O
would O
be O
an O
unanswerable O
argument O
with O
his O
amiable O
Charlotte LOCATION
to O
name O
an O
early O
day O
for O
making O
him O
the O
happiest O
of O
men O
. O
Mr. PERSON
Collins PERSON
's O
return O
into O
Hertfordshire LOCATION
was O
no O
longer O
a O
matter O
of O
pleasure O
to O
Mrs. PERSON
Bennet PERSON
. O
On O
the O
contrary O
, O
she O
was O
as O
much O
disposed O
to O
complain O
of O
it O
as O
her O
husband O
. O
It O
was O
very O
strange O
that O
he O
should O
come O
to O
Longbourn O
instead O
of O
to O
Lucas LOCATION
Lodge LOCATION
; O
it O
was O
also O
very O
inconvenient O
and O
exceedingly O
troublesome O
. O
She O
hated O
having O
visitors O
in O
the O
house O
while O
her O
health O
was O
so O
indifferent O
, O
and O
lovers O
were O
of O
all O
people O
the O
most O
disagreeable O
. O
Such O
were O
the O
gentle O
murmurs O
of O
Mrs. PERSON
Bennet PERSON
, O
and O
they O
gave O
way O
only O
to O
the O
greater O
distress O
of O
Mr. PERSON
Bingley PERSON

continued O
absence O
. O
Neither O
Jane PERSON

Elizabeth PERSON
were O
comfortable O
on O
this O
subject O
. O
Day O
after O
day O
passed O
away O
without O
bringing O
any O
other O
tidings O
of O
him O
than O
the O
report O
which O
shortly O
prevailed O
in O
Meryton O
of O
his O
coming O
no O
more O
to O
Netherfield O
the O
whole O
winter O
; O
a O
report O
which O
highly O
incensed O
Mrs. PERSON
Bennet PERSON
, O
and O
which O
she O
never O
failed O
to O
contradict O
as O
a O
most O
scandalous O
falsehood O
. O
Even O
Elizabeth PERSON
began O
to O
fear O
-- O
not O
that O
Bingley ORGANIZATION
was O
indifferent O
-- O
but O
that O
his O
sisters O
would O
be O
successful O
in O
keeping O
him O
away O

Unwilling O
as O
she O
was O
to O
admit O
an O
idea O
so O
destructive O
of O
Jane PERSON

happiness O

so O
dishonorable O
to O
the O
stability O
of O
her O
lover O

she O
could O
not O
prevent O
its O
frequently O
occurring O

The O
united O
efforts O
of O
his O
two O
unfeeling O
sisters O
and O
of O
his O
overpowering O
friend O
, O
assisted O
by O
the O
attractions O
of O
Miss PERSON
Darcy PERSON
and O
the O
amusements O
of O
London LOCATION
might O
be O
too O
much O
, O
she O
feared O
, O
for O
the O
strength O
of O
his O
attachment O
. O
As O
for O
Jane PERSON
, O
_ O
her O
_ O
anxiety O
under O
this O
suspense O
was O
, O
of O
course O
, O
more O
painful O
than O
Elizabeth PERSON

, O
but O
whatever O
she O
felt O
she O
was O
desirous O
of O
concealing O

between O
herself O

Elizabeth LOCATION
, O
therefore O
, O
the O
subject O
was O
never O
alluded O
to O
. O
But O
as O
no O
such O
delicacy O
restrained O
her O
mother O
, O
an O
hour O
seldom O
passed O
in O
which O
she O
did O
not O
talk O
of O
Bingley LOCATION
, O
express O
her O
impatience O
for O
his O
arrival O
, O
or O
even O
require O
Jane PERSON
to O
confess O
that O
if O
he O
did O
not O
come O
back O
she O
would O
think O
herself O
very O
ill O
used O

It O
needed O
all O
Jane PERSON

steady O
mildness O
to O
bear O
these O
attacks O
with O
tolerable O
tranquillity O
. O
Mr. PERSON
Collins PERSON
returned O
most O
punctually O
on O
Monday DATE
fortnight O
, O
but O
his O
reception O
at O
Longbourn LOCATION
was O
not O
quite O
so O
gracious O
as O
it O
had O
been O
on O
his O
first O
introduction O

He O
was O
too O
happy O

to O
need O
much O
attention O
; O

luckily O
for O
the O
others O

the O

that O

she O
made O
a O
slight O

formal O
apology O

pity O

blaming O
her O

She O
was O
very O
wrong O
in O
singling O
me O
out O

she O

; O
I O
can O
safely O
say O
that O
every O
advance O
to O
intimacy O
began O
on O
her O
side O

But O
I O
pity O
her O
, O
because O
she O
must O
feel O
that O
she O
has O
been O
acting O
wrong O

because O
I O
am O
very O
sure O

the O

I O
need O
not O
explain O
myself O
farther O
; O
and O
though O
_ O
we O
_ O
know O
this O
anxiety O
to O
be O
quite O
needless O
, O
yet O
if O
she O
feels O
it O
, O
it O
will O
easily O
account O
for O
her O
behavior O
to O
me O
; O

so O
deservedly O
dear O
as O
he O
is O
to O
his O
sister O

whatever O
anxiety O
she O
must O
feel O
on O
his O

natural O

I O
can O
not O
but O
wonder O
, O
however O

at O
her O
having O
any O
such O
fears O
now O

if O

certain O

from O
something O

it O
would O
seem O

by O
her O

can O

If O

I O
should O

This O

Mrs. PERSON

about O

Elizabeth PERSON
had O
such O
to O
send O
as O
might O
rather O
give O
contentment O
to O
her O

to O

His O
apparent O
partiality O

subsided O

his O

were O
over O

was O
the O
admirer O
of O
some O
one O

Elizabeth O
was O
watchful O
enough O

Her O
heart O

been O

slightly O

her O
vanity O

would O
have O
been O
his O
only O
choice O

had O
fortune O
permitted O
it O

The O
sudden O
acquisition O
of O
ten O
thousand O
pounds O
was O
the O
most O
remarkable O
charm O
of O
the O
young O
lady O
to O
whom O
he O
was O
now O
rendering O
himself O
agreeable O

but O
Elizabeth LOCATION

less O
clear-sighted O
perhaps O
in O
this O
case O
than O
in O
Charlotte LOCATION

did O
not O
quarrel O
with O
him O
for O
his O
wish O

Nothing O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
could O
be O
more O
natural O

while O
able O
to O
suppose O
that O
it O
cost O
him O
a O
few O
struggles O

her O

she O
was O
ready O

allow O
it O

she O

not O

rather O
looked O

wonder O

scarcely O
allowing O

an O
interval O

utter O
the O
praises O

every O
view O
was O
pointed O
out O

a O
minuteness O
which O
left O

behind O

number O
the O
fields O

tell O
how O

Sir O

stayed O
only O
a O
week O

long O
enough O

most O

settled O

of O

such O

his O
morning O

driving O
him O
out O

but O
when O
he O
went O
away O

the O
whole O

returned O
to O
their O
usual O
employments O

Elizabeth PERSON

thankful O
to O
find O
that O
they O
did O
not O
see O
more O
of O

alteration O

either O
at O

looking O
out O

window O
in O
his O

book-room O

which O
fronted O
the O
road O

The O
room O
in O
which O
the O
ladies O
sat O
was O
backwards O

Elizabeth O
had O
at O
first O
rather O
wondered O
that O
Charlotte LOCATION

not O
prefer O
the O
dining-parlour O
for O
common O
use O
; O
it O
was O
a O
better O
sized O
room O
, O
and O
had O
a O
more O
pleasant O
aspect O
; O
but O
she O
soon O
saw O
that O
her O
friend O
had O
an O
excellent O
reason O
for O
what O
she O
did O
, O
for O
Mr. PERSON
Collins PERSON
would O
undoubtedly O
have O
been O
much O
less O
in O
his O
own O
apartment O

had O
they O
sat O
in O
one O
equally O
lively O
; O
and O
she O
gave O
Charlotte LOCATION
credit O
for O
the O
arrangement O
. O
From O
the O
drawing-room O
they O
could O
distinguish O
nothing O
in O
the O
lane O
, O
and O
were O
indebted O
to O
Mr. PERSON
Collins PERSON
for O
the O
knowledge O
of O
what O
carriages O
went O
along O
, O
and O
how O
often O
especially O
Miss O
de O
Bourgh O
drove O
by O
in O
her O
phaeton O
, O
which O
he O
never O
failed O
coming O
to O
inform O
them O
of O
, O
though O
it O
happened O
almost O
every O
day O
. O
She O
not O
unfrequently O
stopped O
at O
the O
Parsonage O
, O
and O
had O
a O
few O
minutes O
' O
conversation O
with O
Charlotte LOCATION
, O
but O
was O
scarcely O
ever O
prevailed O
upon O
to O
get O
out O
. O
Very O
few O
days O
passed O
in O
which O
Mr. PERSON
Collins PERSON
did O
not O
walk O
to O
Rosings O
, O
and O
not O
many O
in O
which O
his O
wife O
did O
not O
think O
it O
necessary O
to O
go O
likewise O
; O
and O
till O
Elizabeth LOCATION
recollected O
that O
there O
might O
be O
other O
family O
livings O
to O
be O
disposed O
of O
, O
she O
could O
not O
understand O
the O
sacrifice O
of O
so O
many O
hours O
. O
Now O
and O
then O
they O
were O
honored O
with O
a O
call O
from O
her O
ladyship O
, O
and O
nothing O
escaped O
her O
observation O
that O
was O
passing O
in O
the O
room O
during O
these O
visits O
. O
She O
examined O
into O
their O
employments O
, O
looked O
at O
their O
work O
, O
and O
advised O
them O
to O
do O
it O
differently O
; O
found O
fault O
with O
the O
arrangement O
of O
the O
furniture O
; O
or O
detected O
the O
housemaid O
in O
negligence O
; O
and O
if O
she O
accepted O
any O
refreshment O
, O
seemed O
to O
do O
it O
only O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
finding O
out O
that O
Mrs. PERSON
Collins PERSON
's O
joints O
of O
meat O
were O
too O
large O
for O
her O
family O
. O
Elizabeth O
soon O
perceived O
, O
that O
though O
this O
great O
lady O
was O
not O
in O
commission O
of O
the O
peace O
of O
the O
county O
, O
she O
was O
a O
most O
active O
magistrate O
in O
her O
own O
parish O
, O
the O
minutest O
concerns O
of O
which O
were O
carried O
to O
her O
by O
Mr. PERSON
Collins PERSON
; O
and O
whenever O
any O
of O
the O
cottagers O
were O
disposed O
to O
be O
quarrelsome O
, O
discontented O
, O
or O
too O
poor O
, O
she O
sallied O
forth O
into O
the O
village O
to O
settle O
their O
differences O
, O
silence O
their O
complaints O
, O
and O
scold O
them O
into O
harmony O
and O
plenty O
. O
The O
entertainment O
of O
dining O
at O
Rosings O
was O
repeated O
about O
twice O
a O
week O
; O
and O
, O
allowing O
for O
the O
loss O
of O
Sir O
William PERSON
, O
and O
there O
being O
only O
one O
card-table O
in O
the O
evening TIME
, O
every O
such O
entertainment O
was O
the O
counterpart O
of O
the O
first O
. O
Their O
other O
engagements O
were O
few O
, O
as O
the O
style O
of O
living O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
in O
general O
was O
beyond O
Mr. PERSON
Collins PERSON
's O
reach O
. O
This O
, O
however O
, O
was O
no O
evil O
to O
Elizabeth LOCATION
, O
and O
upon O
the O
whole O
she O
spent O
her O
time O
comfortably O
enough O
; O
there O
were O
half-hours O
of O
pleasant O
conversation O
with O
Charlotte LOCATION
, O
and O
the O
weather O
was O
so O
fine O
for O
the O
time O
of O
year O
that O
she O
had O
often O
great O
enjoyment O
out O
of O
doors O
. O
Her O
favorite O
walk O
, O
and O
where O
she O
frequently O
went O
while O
the O
others O
were O
calling O
on O
Lady O
Catherine PERSON
, O
was O
along O
the O
open O
grove O
which O
edged O
that O
side O
of O
the O
park O
, O
where O
there O
was O
a O
nice O
sheltered O
path O
, O
which O
no O
one O
seemed O
to O
value O
but O
herself O
, O
and O
where O
she O
felt O
beyond O
the O
reach O
of O
Lady O
Catherine PERSON

curiosity O
. O
In O
this O
quiet O
way O
, O
the O
first O
fortnight O
of O
her O
visit O
soon O
passed O
away O
. O
Easter O
was O
approaching O
, O
and O
the O
week O
preceding O
it O
was O
to O
bring O
an O
addition O
to O
the O
family O
at O
Rosings O
, O
which O
in O
so O
small O
a O
circle O
must O
be O
important O
. O
Elizabeth O
had O
heard O
soon O
after O
her O
arrival O
that O
Mr. PERSON
Darcy PERSON
was O
expected O
there O
in O
the O
course O
of O
a O
few O
weeks O
, O
and O
though O
there O
were O
not O
many O
of O
her O
acquaintances O
whom O
she O
did O
not O
prefer O
, O
his O
coming O
would O
furnish O
one O
comparatively O
new O
to O
look O
at O
in O
their O
Rosings O
parties O
, O
and O
she O
might O
be O
amused O
in O
seeing O
how O
hopeless O
Miss O
Bingley ORGANIZATION

designs O
on O
him O
were O
, O
by O
his O
behavior O
to O
his O
cousin O

for O
whom O
he O
was O
evidently O
destined O
by O
Lady PERSON
Catherine PERSON
, O
who O
talked O
of O
his O
coming O
with O
the O
greatest O
satisfaction O
, O
spoke O
of O
him O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
highest O
admiration O
, O
and O
seemed O
almost O
angry O
to O
find O
that O
he O
had O
already O
been O
frequently O
seen O
by O
Miss O
Lucas PERSON
and O
herself O
. O
His O
arrival O
was O
soon O
known O
at O

How O
it O

, O
was O
very O

it O
did O

a O

seemed O

the O

it O
struck O
her O
in O

that O

asking O

that O
in O

the O
sound O

In O
an O

an O
inquiry O

imputing O
his O
visit O

a O
wish O
of O

that O

answered O
him O
with O
cold O
civility O

He O
sat O
down O
for O
a O
few O
moments O

up O

walked O
about O

surprised O

several O

came O
towards O

an O
agitated O
manner O

thus O
began O
: O

Elizabeth O

astonishment O
was O
beyond O
expression O

She O
stared O
, O
colored O
, O
doubted O
, O

was O
silent O

This O
he O
considered O
sufficient O
encouragement O
; O

the O
avowal O
of O
all O
that O
he O
felt O
, O

had O
long O
felt O
for O
her O

immediately O
followed O
. O
He O
spoke O
well O
; O
but O
there O
were O
feelings O
besides O
those O
of O
the O
heart O
to O
be O
detailed O
; O
and O
he O
was O
not O
more O
eloquent O
on O
the O
subject O
of O
tenderness O
than O
of O
pride O

His O
sense O
of O
her O
inferiority O

of O
its O
being O
a O
degradation O
-- O
of O
the O
family O
obstacles O
which O
had O
always O
opposed O
to O
inclination O
, O
were O
dwelt O
on O
with O
a O
warmth O
which O
seemed O
due O
to O
the O
consequence O
he O
was O
wounding O
, O
but O
was O
very O
unlikely O
to O
recommend O
his O
suit O
. O
In O
spite O
of O
her O
deeply-rooted O
dislike O
, O
she O
could O
not O
be O
insensible O
to O
the O
compliment O
of O
such O
a O
man O

affection O
, O
and O
though O
her O
intentions O
did O
not O
vary O
for O
an O
instant O

she O
was O
at O
first O
sorry O
for O
the O
pain O
he O
was O
to O
receive O
; O
till O
, O
roused O
to O
resentment O
by O
his O
subsequent O
language O
, O
she O
lost O
all O
compassion O
in O
anger O
. O
She O
tried O
, O
however O
, O
to O
compose O
herself O
to O
answer O
him O
with O
patience O
, O
when O
he O
should O
have O
done O

He O
concluded O
with O
representing O
to O
her O
the O
strength O
of O
that O
attachment O
which O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
all O
his O
endeavors O
, O
he O
had O
found O
impossible O
to O
conquer O
; O
and O
with O
expressing O
his O
hope O
that O
it O
would O
now O
be O
rewarded O
by O
her O
acceptance O
of O
his O
hand O

As O
he O
said O
this O
, O
she O
could O
easily O
see O
that O
he O
had O
no O
doubt O
of O
a O
favourable O
answer O

He O
_ O
spoke O
_ O
of O
apprehension O

anxiety O
, O
but O
his O
countenance O
expressed O
real O
security O
. O
Such O
a O
circumstance O
could O
only O
exasperate O
farther O
, O
and O
, O
when O
he O
ceased O
, O
the O
color O
rose O
into O
her O
cheeks O
, O

she O
said O
: O

His O

pale O

the O

disguise O
of O

is O
my O
abhorrence O

Nor O
am O
I O
ashamed O
of O
the O
feelings O
I O
related O

They O
were O
natural O

just O

Could O
you O
expect O
me O
to O
rejoice O
in O
the O
inferiority O

to O
congratulate O
myself O
on O
the O

so O
decidedly O
beneath O

'' O
Elizabeth O
felt O
herself O
growing O
more O
angry O
every O
moment O
; O
yet O
she O
tried O
to O
the O
utmost O
to O
speak O
with O
composure O
when O
she O
said O
: O
`` O
You O
are O
mistaken O
, O
Mr. PERSON
Darcy PERSON
, O
if O
you O
suppose O
that O
the O
mode O
of O
your O
declaration O
affected O
me O
in O
any O
other O
way O
, O
than O
as O
it O
spared O
me O
the O
concern O
which O
I O
might O
have O
felt O
in O
refusing O
you O
, O
had O
you O
behaved O
in O
a O
more O
gentlemanlike O
manner O
. O
'' O
She O
saw O
him O
start O
at O
this O
, O
but O
he O
said O
nothing O
, O
and O
she O
continued O
: O
`` O
You O
could O
not O
have O
made O
the O
offer O
of O
your O
hand O
in O
any O
possible O
way O
that O
would O
have O
tempted O
me O
to O
accept O
it O

'' O
Again O
his O
astonishment O
was O
obvious O
; O
and O
he O
looked O
at O
her O
with O
an O
expression O
of O
mingled O
incredulity O
and O
mortification O
. O
She O
went O
on O
: O
`` O
From O
the O
very O
beginning O
-- O
from O
the O
first O
moment O
, O
I O
may O
almost O
say O
-- O
of O
my O
acquaintance O
with O
you O
, O
your O
manners O
, O
impressing O
me O
with O
the O
fullest O
belief O
of O
your O
arrogance O
, O
your O
conceit O
, O
and O
your O
selfish O
disdain O
of O
the O
feelings O
of O
others O
, O
were O
such O
as O
to O
form O
the O
groundwork O
of O
disapprobation O
on O
which O
succeeding O
events O
have O
built O
so O
immovable O
a O
dislike O
; O
and O
I O
had O
not O
known O
you O
a O
month O
before O
I O
felt O
that O
you O
were O
the O
last O
man O
in O
the O
world O
whom O
I O
could O
ever O
be O
prevailed O
on O
to O

'' O
`` O
You O
have O
said O
quite O
enough O

madam O

I O
perfectly O
comprehend O
your O
feelings O
, O

have O
now O
only O
to O
be O
ashamed O

what O
my O

Forgive O
me O

'' O
And O
with O
these O
words O
he O
hastily O
left O
the O
room O
, O
and O
Elizabeth PERSON
heard O
him O
the O
next O
moment O
open O
the O
front O
door O
and O
quit O
the O
house O
. O
The O
tumult O
of O
her O
mind O
, O
was O
now O
painfully O
great O
. O
She O
knew O
not O
how O
to O
support O
herself O
, O
and O
from O
actual O
weakness O
sat O
down O
and O
cried O
for O
half-an-hour O
. O
Her O
astonishment O
, O
as O
she O
reflected O
on O
what O
had O
passed O
, O
was O
increased O
by O
every O
review O
of O
it O
. O
That O
she O
should O
receive O
an O
offer O
of O
marriage O
from O
Mr. PERSON
Darcy PERSON
! O
That O
he O
should O
have O
been O
in O
love O
with O
her O
for O
so O
many O
months O
! O
So O
much O
in O
love O
as O
to O
wish O
to O
marry O
her O
in O
spite O
of O
all O
the O
objections O
which O
had O
made O
him O
prevent O
his O
friend O

marrying O
her O
sister O
, O
and O
which O
must O
appear O
at O
least O
with O
equal O
force O
in O
his O
own O
case O
-- O
was O
almost O
incredible O
! O
It O
was O
gratifying O
to O
have O
inspired O
unconsciously O
so O
strong O
an O
affection O

But O
his O
pride O
, O
his O
abominable O
pride O
-- O
his O
shameless O
avowal O
of O
what O
he O
had O
done O
with O
respect O
to O
Jane PERSON
-- O
his O
unpardonable O
assurance O
in O
acknowledging O
, O
though O
he O
could O
not O
justify O
it O
, O
and O
the O
unfeeling O
manner O
in O
which O

mentioned O
Mr. PERSON

his O
cruelty O
towards O

he O

not O

soon O
overcame O
the O
pity O
which O
the O
consideration O
of O
his O
attachment O
had O
for O
a O
moment O
excited O
. O
She O
continued O
in O
very O
agitated O
reflections O
till O
the O
sound O
of O
Lady O
Catherine PERSON

carriage O
made O
her O
feel O
how O
unequal O
she O
was O
to O
encounter O
Charlotte LOCATION

observation O
, O

hurried O
her O
away O
to O
her O
room O

Chapter O
35 O
Elizabeth PERSON
awoke O
the O
next O
morning O
to O
the O
same O
thoughts O
and O
meditations O
which O
had O
at O
length O
closed O
her O
eyes O
. O
She O
could O
not O
yet O
recover O
from O
the O
surprise O
of O
what O
had O
happened O
; O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
think O
of O
anything O
else O
; O
and O
, O
totally O
indisposed O
for O
employment O
, O
she O
resolved O
, O
soon O
after O
breakfast O
, O
to O
indulge O
herself O
in O
air O
and O
exercise O
. O
She O
was O
proceeding O
directly O
to O
her O
favorite O
walk O
, O
when O
the O
recollection O
of O
Mr. PERSON
Darcy PERSON
's O
sometimes O
coming O
there O
stopped O
her O
, O
and O
instead O
of O
entering O
the O
park O
, O
she O
turned O
up O
the O
lane O
, O
which O
led O
farther O
from O
the O
turnpike-road O
. O
The O
park O
paling O
was O
still O
the O
boundary O
on O
one O
side O
, O
and O
she O
soon O
passed O
one O
of O
the O
gates O
into O
the O
ground O
. O
After O
walking O
two O
or O
three O
times O
along O
that O
part O
of O
the O
lane O
, O
she O
was O
tempted O
, O
by O
the O
pleasantness O
of O
the O
morning TIME
, O
to O
stop O
at O
the O
gates O
and O
look O
into O
the O
park O
. O
The O
five O
weeks O
which O
she O
had O
now O
passed O
in O
Kent O
had O
made O
a O
great O
difference O
in O
the O
country O
, O
and O
every O
day O
was O
adding O
to O
the O
verdure O
of O
the O
early O
trees O
. O
She O
was O
on O
the O
point O
of O
continuing O
her O
walk O
, O
when O
she O
caught O
a O
glimpse O
of O
a O
gentleman O
within O
the O
sort O
of O
grove O
which O
edged O
the O
park O
; O
he O
was O
moving O
that O
way O
; O
and O
, O
fearful O
of O
its O
being O
Mr. PERSON
Darcy PERSON
, O
she O
was O
directly O
retreating O
. O
But O
the O
person O
who O
advanced O
was O
now O
near O
enough O
to O
see O
her O
, O
and O
stepping O
forward O
with O
eagerness O
, O
pronounced O
her O
name O
. O
She O
had O
turned O
away O
; O
but O
on O
hearing O
herself O
called O
, O
though O
in O
a O
voice O
which O
proved O
it O
to O
be O
Mr. PERSON
Darcy PERSON
, O
she O
moved O
again O
towards O
the O
gate O
. O
He O
had O
by O
that O
time O
reached O
it O
also O
, O
and O
, O
holding O
out O
a O
letter O
, O
which O
she O
instinctively O
took O
, O
said O
, O
with O
a O
look O
of O
haughty O
composure O
, O
`` O
I O
have O
been O
walking O
in O
the O
grove O
some O
time O
in O
the O
hope O
of O
meeting O
you O

Will O
you O
do O
me O
the O
honor O
of O
reading O
that O
letter O
? O
'' O
And O
then O
, O
with O
a O
slight O
bow O
, O
turned O
again O
into O
the O
plantation O
, O
and O
was O
soon O
out O
of O
sight O
. O
With O
no O
expectation O
of O
pleasure O
, O
but O
with O
the O
strongest O
curiosity O
, O
Elizabeth PERSON
opened O
the O
letter O
, O
and O
, O
to O
her O
still O
increasing O
wonder O
, O
perceived O
an O
envelope O
containing O
two O
sheets O
of O
letter-paper O
, O
written O
quite O
through O
, O
in O
a O
very O
close O
hand O
. O
The O
envelope O
itself O
was O
likewise O
full O
. O
Pursuing O
her O
way O
along O
the O
lane O
, O
she O
then O
began O
it O
. O
It O
was O
dated O
from O
Rosings PERSON
, O
at O
eight O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning TIME
, O
and O
was O
as O
follows O
: O
-- O
`` O
Be O
not O
alarmed O
, O
madam O
, O
on O
receiving O
this O
letter O

by O
the O
apprehension O
of O

containing O
any O
repetition O
of O
those O
sentiments O
or O
renewal O
of O
those O
offers O
which O
were O
last O
night O
so O
disgusting O
to O
you O

write O
without O
any O
intention O
of O
paining O
you O

humbling O
myself O
, O
by O
dwelling O
on O
wishes O
which O
, O
for O
the O
happiness O
of O
both O

can O
not O
be O
too O
soon O
forgotten O
; O
and O
the O
effort O
which O
the O
formation O
and O
the O
perusal O
of O
this O
letter O
must O
occasion O
, O
should O
have O
been O
spared O

not O
my O
character O
required O
it O
to O
be O
written O
and O
read O

You O
must O
, O
therefore O
, O
pardon O
the O
freedom O
with O
which O
I O
demand O
your O
attention O
; O
your O
feelings O
, O
I O
know O
, O
will O
bestow O
it O
unwillingly O
, O

I O
demand O
it O
of O
your O
justice O

`` O
Two O
offenses O

off O

companion O

young O

scarcely O
any O

on O
our O
patronage O

and O
who O
had O
been O
brought O
up O
to O

be O
a O
depravity O

to O
which O
the O

could O
be O
the O
growth O

from O
the O
severity O
of O
that O
blame O

was O
last O
night O
so O
liberally O
bestowed O

But O
it O
was O
not O

the O
evening O
of O
the O
dance O
at O
Netherfield O
that O
I O
had O
any O
apprehension O

by O
Sir O
William PERSON
Lucas PERSON

accidental O
information O

that O
Bingley ORGANIZATION
's O
attentions O
to O
your O

given O
rise O

a O
general O
expectation O

of O
it O
as O
a O
certain O
event O

of O

the O
time O
alone O
could O
be O
undecided O

From O
that O
moment O
I O
observed O
my O
friend O

behavior O
attentively O
; O
and O
I O
could O
then O
perceive O
that O
his O
partiality O
for O
Miss O
Bennet PERSON
was O
beyond O
what O
I O
had O
ever O
witnessed O
in O
him O
. O
Your O
sister O
I O
also O
watched O

Her O
look O

manners O
were O
open O

cheerful O

and O
engaging O
as O
ever O
, O
but O
without O
any O
symptom O
of O
peculiar O
regard O
, O
and O
I O
remained O
convinced O
from O
the O
evening O
's O
scrutiny O
, O
that O
though O
she O
received O
his O
attentions O
with O
pleasure O
, O
she O
did O
not O
invite O
them O
by O
any O
participation O
of O
sentiment O
. O
If O
_ O
you O
_ O
have O
not O
been O
mistaken O
here O
, O
_ O
I O
_ O
must O
have O
been O
in O
error O
. O
Your O
superior O
knowledge O
of O
your O

must O
make O
the O
latter O
probable O

If O
it O
be O
so O
, O

I O
have O
been O
misled O
by O
such O
error O
to O
inflict O
pain O
on O
her O
, O
your O
resentment O
has O
not O
been O
unreasonable O
. O
But O
I O
shall O
not O
scruple O
to O
assert O
, O
that O
the O
serenity O
of O
your O
sister O
's O
countenance O
and O
air O
was O
such O
as O
might O
have O
given O
the O
most O
acute O
observer O
a O
conviction O
that O
, O
however O
amiable O
her O
temper O
, O
her O
heart O
was O
not O
likely O
to O
be O
easily O
touched O
. O
That O
I O
was O
desirous O
of O
believing O
her O
indifferent O
is O
certain O
-- O
but O
I O
will O
venture O
to O
say O
that O
my O
investigation O
and O
decisions O
are O
not O
usually O
influenced O
by O
my O
hopes O
or O
fears O
. O
I O
did O
not O
believe O
her O
to O
be O
indifferent O
because O
I O
wished O
it O
; O
I O
believed O
it O
on O
impartial O
conviction O
, O
as O
truly O
as O
I O
wished O
it O
in O
reason O
. O
My O
objections O
to O
the O
marriage O
were O
not O
merely O
those O
which O
I O
last TIME
night TIME
acknowledged O
to O
have O
the O
utmost O
force O
of O
passion O
to O
put O
aside O
, O
in O
my O
own O
case O
; O
the O
want O
of O
connection O
could O
not O
be O
so O
great O
an O
evil O
to O
my O
friend O
as O
to O
me O
. O
But O
there O
were O
other O
causes O
of O
repugnance O
; O
causes O
which O
, O
though O
still O
existing O
, O
and O
existing O
to O
an O
equal O
degree O
in O
both O
instances O
, O
I O
had O
myself O
endeavored O

forget O

they O
were O
not O

These O
causes O
must O
be O
stated O
, O

briefly O
. O
The O
situation O
of O
your O
mother O

was O
nothing O
in O
comparison O

frequently O

almost O
uniformly O

occasionally O

by O
your O

farther O
that O

passed O
that TIME
evening TIME

my O
opinion O

every O

The O
part O

explained O

His O
sisters O
' O
uneasiness O
had O
been O
equally O
excited O
with O
my O
own O
; O
our O
coincidence O
of O
feeling O
was O
soon O
discovered O
, O
and O
, O
alike O
sensible O
that O
no O
time O
was O
to O
be O
lost O
in O
detaching O
their O
brother O
, O
we O
shortly O
resolved O
on O
joining O
him O
directly O
in O
London LOCATION
. O
We O
accordingly O
went O
-- O
and O
there O
I O
readily O
engaged O
in O
the O
office O
of O
pointing O
out O
to O
my O
friend O
the O
certain O
evils O
of O
such O
a O
choice O
. O
I O
described O
, O
and O
enforced O
them O
earnestly O
. O
But O
, O
however O
this O
remonstrance O
might O
have O
staggered O
or O
delayed O
his O
determination O
, O
I O
do O
not O
suppose O
that O
it O
would O
ultimately O
have O
prevented O
the O
marriage O
, O
had O
it O
not O
been O
seconded O
by O
the O
assurance O
that O
I O
hesitated O
not O
in O
giving O
, O
of O
your O
sister O
's O
indifference O
. O
He O
had O
before O
believed O
her O
to O
return O
his O
affection O
with O
sincere O
, O
if O
not O
with O
equal O
regard O
. O
But O
Bingley ORGANIZATION
has O
great O
natural O
modesty O
, O
with O
a O
stronger O
dependence O
on O
my O
judgement O
than O
on O
his O
own O

To O
convince O
him O
, O
therefore O
, O
that O
he O
had O
deceived O
himself O
, O
was O
no O
very O
difficult O
point O
. O
To O
persuade O
him O
against O
returning O
into O
Hertfordshire LOCATION

when O
that O
conviction O
had O
been O
given O
, O
was O
scarcely O
the O
work O
of O
a O
moment O
. O
I O
can O
not O
blame O
myself O
for O
having O
done O
thus O
much O
. O
There O
is O
but O
one O
part O
of O
my O
conduct O
in O
the O
whole O
affair O
on O
which O
I O
do O
not O
reflect O
with O
satisfaction O
; O
it O
is O
that O
I O
condescended O
to O
adopt O
the O
measures O
of O
art O
so O
far O
as O
to O
conceal O
from O
him O
your O
sister O

being O
in O
town O
. O
I O
knew O
it O
myself O
, O
as O
it O
was O
known O
to O
Miss LOCATION
Bingley LOCATION
; O
but O
her O
brother O
is O
even O
yet O
ignorant O
of O
it O
. O
That O
they O
might O
have O
met O
without O
ill O
consequence O
is O
perhaps O
probable O
; O
but O
his O
regard O
did O
not O
appear O
to O
me O
enough O
extinguished O
for O
him O
to O
see O
her O
without O
some O
danger O
. O
Perhaps O
this O
concealment O
, O
this O
disguise O
was O
beneath O
me O
; O
it O
is O
done O

it O
was O
done O
for O
the O
best O

this O
subject O
I O
have O
nothing O
more O
to O

the O
sentiments O

suspicion O

`` O
My O
excellent O

died O
about O
five O

his O
attachment O

to O
the O

so O
steady O

that O
in O

he O

recommended O

promote O
his O
advancement O

the O

that O
his O

within O
half O

wrote O
to O
inform O

, O
having O

against O

he O
hoped O
I O
should O
not O

it O
unreasonable O

him O
to O
expect O
some O
more O
immediate O
pecuniary O
advantage O
, O
in O
lieu O
of O
the O
preferment O
, O
by O
which O
he O
could O
not O
be O
benefited O
. O
He O
had O
some O
intention O
, O
he O
added O
, O
of O
studying O
law O
, O
and O
I O
must O
be O
aware O
that O
the O
interest O
of O
one O
thousand O
pounds O
would O
be O
a O
very O
insufficient O
support O
therein O
. O
I O
rather O
wished O
, O
than O
believed O
him O
to O
be O
sincere O
; O
but O
, O
at O
any O
rate O
, O
was O
perfectly O
ready O
to O
accede O
to O
his O
proposal O
. O
I O
knew O
that O
Mr. PERSON
Wickham PERSON
ought O
not O
to O
be O
a O
clergyman O
; O
the O
business O
was O
therefore O
soon O
settled O
-- O
he O
resigned O
all O
claim O
to O
assistance O
in O
the O
church O
, O
were O
it O
possible O
that O
he O
could O
ever O
be O
in O
a O
situation O
to O
receive O
it O
, O
and O
accepted O
in O
return O
three O
thousand O
pounds O
. O
All O
connection O
between O
us O
seemed O
now O
dissolved O
. O
I O
thought O
too O
ill O
of O
him O
to O
invite O
him O
to O
Pemberley LOCATION
, O
or O
admit O
his O
society O
in O
town O
. O
In O
town O
I O
believe O
he O
chiefly O
lived O
, O
but O
his O
studying O
the O
law O
was O
a O
mere O
pretence O
, O
and O
being O
now O
free O
from O
all O
restraint O
, O
his O
life O
was O
a O
life O
of O
idleness O
and O
dissipation O
. O
For O
about O
three O
years O
I O
heard O
little O
of O
him O
; O
but O
on O
the O
decease O
of O
the O
incumbent O
of O
the O
living O
which O
had O
been O
designed O
for O
him O
, O
he O
applied O
to O
me O
again O
by O
letter O
for O
the O
presentation O
. O
His O
circumstances O
, O
he O
assured O
me O
, O
and O
I O
had O
no O
difficulty O
in O
believing O
it O
, O
were O
exceedingly O
bad O
. O
He O
had O
found O
the O
law O
a O
most O
unprofitable O
study O
, O
and O
was O
now O
absolutely O
resolved O
on O
being O
ordained O
, O
if O
I O
would O
present O
him O
to O
the O
living O
in O
question O
-- O
of O
which O
he O
trusted O
there O
could O
be O
little O
doubt O
, O
as O
he O
was O
well O
assured O
that O
I O
had O
no O
other O
person O
to O
provide O
for O
, O
and O
I O
could O
not O
have O
forgotten O
my O
revered O
father O
's O
intentions O
. O
You O
will O
hardly O
blame O
me O
for O
refusing O
to O
comply O
with O
this O
entreaty O
, O
or O
for O
resisting O
every O
repetition O
to O
it O
. O
His O
resentment O
was O
in O
proportion O
to O
the O
distress O
of O
his O
circumstances O
-- O
and O
he O
was O
doubtless O
as O
violent O
in O
his O
abuse O
of O
me O
to O
others O
as O
in O
his O
reproaches O
to O
myself O

After O
this O
period O
every O

How O

If O
Elizabeth PERSON
, O
when O
Mr. PERSON
Darcy PERSON
gave O
her O
the O
letter O
, O
did O
not O
expect O
it O
to O
contain O
a O
renewal O
of O
his O
offers O
, O
she O
had O
formed O
no O
expectation O
at O
all O
of O
its O
contents O
. O
But O
such O
as O
they O
were O
, O
it O
may O
well O
be O
supposed O
how O
eagerly O
she O
went O
through O
them O
, O
and O
what O
a O
contrariety O
of O
emotion O
they O
excited O
. O
Her O
feelings O
as O
she O
read O
were O
scarcely O
to O
be O
defined O
. O
With O
amazement O
did O
she O
first O
understand O
that O
he O
believed O
any O
apology O
to O
be O
in O
his O
power O
; O
and O
steadfastly O
was O
she O
persuaded O
, O
that O
he O
could O
have O
no O
explanation O
to O
give O
, O
which O
a O
just O
sense O
of O
shame O
would O
not O
conceal O
. O
With O
a O
strong O
prejudice O
against O
everything O
he O
might O
say O
, O
she O
began O
his O
account O
of O
what O
had O
happened O
at O
Netherfield LOCATION
. O
She O
read O
with O
an O
eagerness O
which O
hardly O
left O
her O
power O
of O
comprehension O
, O
and O
from O
impatience O
of O
knowing O
what O
the O
next O
sentence O
might O
bring O
, O
was O
incapable O
of O
attending O
to O
the O
sense O
of O
the O
one O
before O
her O
eyes O
. O
His O
belief O
of O
her O
sister O
's O
insensibility O
she O
instantly O
resolved O
to O
be O
false O
; O
and O
his O
account O
of O
the O
real O
, O
the O
worst O
objections O
to O
the O
match O
, O
made O
her O
too O
angry O
to O
have O
any O
wish O
of O
doing O
him O
justice O
. O
He O
expressed O
no O
regret O
for O
what O
he O
had O
done O
which O
satisfied O
her O
; O
his O
style O
was O
not O
penitent O
, O
but O
haughty O
. O
It O
was O
all O
pride O
and O
insolence O
. O
But O
when O
this O
subject O
was O
succeeded O
by O
his O
account O
of O
Mr. PERSON
Wickham PERSON
-- O
when O
she O
read O
with O
somewhat O
clearer O
attention O
a O
relation O
of O
events O
which O
, O
if O
true O
, O
must O
overthrow O
every O
cherished O
opinion O
of O
his O
worth O
, O
and O
which O
bore O
so O
alarming O
an O
affinity O
to O
his O
own O
history O
of O
himself O
-- O
her O
feelings O
were O
yet O
more O
acutely O
painful O
and O
more O
difficult O
of O
definition O
. O
Astonishment O
, O
apprehension O
, O
and O
even O
horror O
, O
oppressed O
her O
. O
She O
wished O
to O
discredit O
it O
entirely O
, O
repeatedly O
exclaiming O
, O
`` O
This O
must O
be O
false O
! O
This O
can O
not O
be O
! O
This O
must O
be O
the O
grossest O
falsehood O
! O
'' O
-- O
and O
when O
she O
had O
gone O
through O
the O
whole O
letter O
, O
though O
scarcely O
knowing O
anything O
of O
the O
last O
page O
or O
two O
, O
put O
it O
hastily O
away O
, O
protesting O
that O
she O
would O
not O
regard O
it O
, O
that O
she O
would O
never O
look O
in O
it O
again O
. O
In O
this O
perturbed O
state O
of O
mind O
, O
with O
thoughts O
that O
could O
rest O
on O
nothing O
, O
she O
walked O
on O
; O
but O
it O
would O
not O
do O
; O
in O
half O
a O
minute O
the O
letter O
was O
unfolded O
again O
, O
and O
collecting O
herself O
as O
well O
as O
she O
could O
, O
she O
again O
began O
the O
mortifying O
perusal O
of O
all O
that O
related O
to O
Wickham PERSON
, O
and O
commanded O
herself O
so O
far O
as O
to O
examine O
the O
meaning O
of O
every O
sentence O
. O
The O
account O
of O
his O
connection O
with O
the O
Pemberley PERSON
family O
was O
exactly O
what O
he O
had O
related O
himself O
; O
and O
the O
kindness O
of O
the O
late O
Mr. PERSON
Darcy PERSON
, O
though O
she O
had O
not O
before O
known O
its O
extent O
, O
agreed O
equally O
well O
with O
his O
own O
words O
. O
So O
far O
each O
recital O
confirmed O
the O
other O
; O
but O
when O
she O
came O
to O
the O
will O
, O
the O
difference O
was O
great O
. O
What O
Wickham PERSON
had O
said O
of O
the O
living O
was O
fresh O
in O
her O
memory O
, O
and O
as O
she O
recalled O
his O
very O
words O
, O
it O
was O
impossible O
not O
to O
feel O
that O
there O
was O
gross O
duplicity O
on O
one O
side O
or O
the O
other O
; O
and O
, O
for O
a O
few O
moments O
, O
she O
flattered O
herself O
that O
her O
wishes O
did O
not O
err O
. O
But O
when O
she O
read O
and O
re-read O
with O
the O
closest O
attention O
, O
the O
particulars O
immediately O
following O
of O
Wickham ORGANIZATION
's O
resigning O
all O
pretensions O
to O
the O
living O
, O
of O
his O
receiving O
in O
lieu O
so O
considerable O
a O
sum O
as O
three O
thousand O
pounds O
, O
again O
was O
she O
forced O
to O
hesitate O
. O
She O
put O
down O
the O
letter O
, O
weighed O
every O
circumstance O
with O
what O
she O
meant O
to O
be O
impartiality O
-- O
deliberated O
on O
the O
probability O
of O
each O
statement O
-- O
but O
with O
little O
success O
. O
On O
both O
sides O
it O
was O
only O
assertion O
. O
Again O
she O
read O
on O
; O
but O
every O
line O
proved O
more O
clearly O
that O
the O
affair O
, O
which O
she O
had O
believed O
it O
impossible O
that O
any O
contrivance O
could O
so O
represent O
as O
to O
render O
Mr. PERSON
Darcy PERSON
's O
conduct O
in O
it O
less O
than O
infamous O
, O
was O
capable O
of O
a O
turn O
which O
must O
make O
him O
entirely O
blameless O
throughout O
the O
whole O
. O
The O
extravagance O
and O
general O
profligacy O
which O
he O
scrupled O
not O
to O
lay O
at O
Mr. PERSON
Wickham PERSON
's O
charge O
, O
exceedingly O
shocked O
her O
; O
the O
more O
so O
, O
as O
she O
could O
bring O
no O
proof O
of O
its O
injustice O
. O
She O
had O
never O
heard O
of O
him O
before O
his O
entrance O
into O
the O
-- O
shire O
Militia O
, O
in O
which O
he O
had O
engaged O
at O
the O
persuasion O
of O
the O
young O
man O
who O
, O
on O
meeting O
him O
accidentally O
in O
town O
, O
had O
there O
renewed O
a O
slight O
acquaintance O
. O
Of O
his O
former O
way O
of O
life O
nothing O
had O
been O
known O
in O
Hertfordshire LOCATION
but O
what O
he O
told O
himself O
. O
As O
to O
his O
real O
character O
, O
had O
information O
been O
in O
her O
power O
, O
she O
had O
never O
felt O
a O
wish O
of O
inquiring O
. O
His O
countenance O
, O
voice O
, O
and O
manner O
had O
established O
him O
at O
once O
in O
the O
possession O
of O
every O
virtue O
. O
She O
tried O
to O
recollect O
some O
instance O
of O
goodness O
, O
some O
distinguished O
trait O
of O
integrity O
or O
benevolence O
, O
that O
might O
rescue O
him O
from O
the O
attacks O
of O
Mr. PERSON
Darcy PERSON
; O
or O
at O
least O
, O
by O
the O
predominance O
of O
virtue O
, O
atone O
for O
those O
casual O
errors O
under O
which O
she O
would O
endeavor O
to O
class O
what O
Mr. PERSON
Darcy PERSON
had O
described O
as O
the O
idleness O
and O
vice O
of O
many O
years O
' O
continuance O
. O
But O
no O
such O
recollection O
befriended O
her O
. O
She O
could O
see O
him O
instantly O
before O
her O
, O
in O
every O
charm O
of O
air O
and O
address O
; O
but O
she O
could O
remember O
no O
more O
substantial O
good O
than O
the O
general O
approbation O
of O
the O
neighborhood O
, O
and O
the O
regard O
which O
his O
social O
powers O
had O
gained O
him O
in O
the O
mess O
. O
After O
pausing O
on O
this O
point O
a O
considerable O
while O
, O
she O
once O
more O
continued O
to O
read O
. O
But O
, O
alas O
! O
the O
story O
which O
followed O
, O
of O
his O
designs O
on O
Miss PERSON
Darcy PERSON
, O
received O
some O
confirmation O
from O
what O
had O
passed O
between O
Colonel LOCATION
Fitzwilliam LOCATION
and O
herself O
only O
the O
morning O
before O
; O
and O
at O
last O
she O
was O
referred O
for O
the O
truth O
of O
every O
particular O
to O
Colonel LOCATION
Fitzwilliam LOCATION
himself O
-- O
from O
whom O
she O
had O
previously O
received O
the O
information O
of O
his O
near O
concern O
in O
all O
his O
cousin O
's O
affairs O
, O
and O
whose O
character O
she O
had O
no O
reason O
to O
question O
. O
At O
one O
time O
she O
had O
almost O
resolved O
on O
applying O
to O
him O
, O
but O
the O
idea O
was O
checked O
by O
the O
awkwardness O
of O
the O
application O
, O
and O
at O
length O
wholly O
banished O
by O
the O
conviction O
that O
Mr. PERSON
Darcy PERSON
would O
never O
have O
hazarded O
such O
a O
proposal O
, O
if O
he O
had O
not O
been O
well O
assured O
of O
his O
cousin O
's O
corroboration O
. O
She O
perfectly O
remembered O
everything O
that O
had O
passed O
in O
conversation O
between O
Wickham PERSON
and O
herself O
, O
in O
their O
first O
evening O
at O
Mr. PERSON
Phillips PERSON
's O
. O
Many O
of O
his O
expressions O
were O
still O
fresh O
in O
her O
memory O
. O
She O
was O
_ O
now O
_ O
struck O
with O
the O
impropriety O
of O
such O
communications O
to O
a O
stranger O
, O
and O
wondered O
it O
had O
escaped O
her O
before O
. O
She O
saw O
the O
indelicacy O
of O
putting O
himself O
forward O
as O
he O
had O
done O
, O
and O
the O
inconsistency O
of O
his O
professions O
with O
his O
conduct O
. O
She O
remembered O
that O
he O
had O
boasted O
of O
having O
no O
fear O
of O
seeing O
Mr. PERSON
Darcy PERSON
-- O
that O
Mr. PERSON
Darcy PERSON
might O
leave O
the O
country O
, O
but O
that O
_ O
he O
_ O
should O
stand O
his O
ground O
; O
yet O
he O
had O
avoided O
the O
Netherfield LOCATION
ball O
the O
very O
next O
week O
. O
She O
remembered O
also O
that O
, O
till O
the O
Netherfield PERSON
family O
had O
quitted O
the O
country O
, O
he O
had O
told O
his O
story O
to O
no O
one O
but O
herself O
; O
but O
that O
after O
their O
removal O
it O
had O
been O
everywhere O
discussed O
; O
that O
he O
had O
then O
no O
reserves O
, O
no O
scruples O
in O
sinking O
Mr. PERSON
Darcy PERSON
's O
character O
, O
though O
he O
had O
assured O
her O
that O
respect O
for O
the O
father O
would O
always O
prevent O
his O
exposing O
the O
son O
. O
How O
differently O
did O
everything O
now O
appear O
in O
which O
he O
was O
concerned O
! O
His O
attentions O
to O
Miss PERSON
King PERSON
were O
now O
the O
consequence O
of O
views O
solely O
and O
hatefully O
mercenary O
; O
and O
the O
mediocrity O
of O
her O
fortune O
proved O
no O
longer O
the O
moderation O
of O
his O
wishes O
, O
but O
his O
eagerness O
to O
grasp O
at O
anything O
. O
His O
behavior O
to O
herself O
could O
now O
have O
had O
no O
tolerable O
motive O
; O
he O
had O
either O
been O
deceived O
with O
regard O
to O
her O
fortune O
, O
or O
had O
been O
gratifying O
his O
vanity O
by O
encouraging O
the O
preference O
which O
she O
believed O
she O
had O
most O
incautiously O
shown O
. O
Every O
lingering O
struggle O
in O
his O
favor O
grew O
fainter O
and O
fainter O
; O
and O
in O
farther O
justification O
of O
Mr. PERSON
Darcy PERSON
, O
she O
could O
not O
but O
allow O
that O
Mr. PERSON
Bingley PERSON
, O
when O
questioned O
by O
Jane PERSON
, O
had O
long O
ago O
asserted O
his O
blamelessness O
in O
the O
affair O
; O
that O
proud O
and O
repulsive O
as O
were O
his O
manners O
, O
she O
had O
never O
, O
in O
the O
whole O
course O
of O
their O
acquaintance O
-- O
an O
acquaintance O
which O
had O
latterly O
brought O
them O
much O
together O
, O
and O
given O
her O
a O
sort O
of O
intimacy O
with O
his O
ways O
-- O
seen O
anything O
that O
betrayed O
him O
to O
be O
unprincipled O
or O
unjust O
-- O
anything O
that O
spoke O
him O
of O
irreligious O
or O
immoral O
habits O
; O
that O
among O
his O
own O
connections O
he O
was O
esteemed O
and O
valued O
-- O
that O
even O
Wickham PERSON
had O
allowed O
him O
merit O
as O
a O
brother O
, O
and O
that O
she O
had O
often O
heard O
him O
speak O
so O
affectionately O
of O
his O
sister O
as O
to O
prove O
him O
capable O
of O
_ O
some O
_ O
amiable O
feeling O
; O
that O
had O
his O
actions O
been O
what O
Mr. PERSON
Wickham PERSON
represented O
them O
, O
so O
gross O
a O
violation O
of O
everything O
right O
could O
hardly O
have O
been O
concealed O
from O
the O
world O
; O
and O
that O
friendship O
between O
a O
person O
capable O
of O
it O
, O
and O
such O
an O
amiable O
man O
as O
Mr. PERSON
Bingley PERSON
, O
was O
incomprehensible O
. O
She O
grew O
absolutely O
ashamed O
of O
herself O
. O
Of O
neither O
Darcy PERSON
nor O
Wickham PERSON
could O
she O
think O
without O
feeling O
she O
had O
been O
blind O
, O
partial O
, O
prejudiced O
, O
absurd O
. O
`` O
How O
despicably O
I O
have O
acted O
! O

she O
cried O
; O
`` O
I O
, O
who O

'' O
From O
herself O
to O
Jane PERSON
-- O
from O
Jane PERSON
to PERSON
Bingley PERSON
, O
her O
thoughts O
were O
in O
a O
line O
which O
soon O
brought O
to O
her O
recollection O
that O
Mr. PERSON
Darcy PERSON
's O
explanation O
_ O
there O
_ O
had O
appeared O
very O
insufficient O
, O
and O
she O
read O
it O
again O
. O
Widely O
different O
was O
the O
effect O
of O
a O
second O
perusal O
. O
How O
could O
she O
deny O
that O
credit O
to O
his O
assertions O
in O
one O
instance O
, O
which O
she O
had O
been O
obliged O
to O
give O
in O
the O
other O
? O
He O
declared O
himself O
to O
be O
totally O
unsuspicious O
of O
her O
sister O
's O
attachment O
; O
and O
she O
could O
not O
help O
remembering O
what O
Charlotte LOCATION
's O
opinion O
had O
always O
been O
. O
Neither O
could O
she O
deny O
the O
justice O
of O
his O
description O
of O
Jane PERSON
. O
She O
felt O
that O
Jane PERSON
's O
feelings O
, O
though O
fervent O
, O
were O
little O
displayed O
, O
and O
that O
there O
was O
a O
constant O
complacency O
in O
her O
air O
and O
manner O
not O
often O
united O
with O
great O
sensibility O
. O
When O
she O
came O
to O
that O
part O
of O
the O
letter O
in O
which O
her O
family O
were O
mentioned O
in O
terms O
of O
such O
mortifying O
, O
yet O
merited O
reproach O
, O
her O
sense O
of O
shame O
was O
severe O
. O
The O
justice O
of O
the O
charge O
struck O
her O
too O
forcibly O
for O
denial O
, O
and O
the O
circumstances O
to O
which O
he O
particularly O
alluded O
as O
having O
passed O
at O
the O
Netherfield LOCATION
ball O

as O
confirming O
all O

disapprobation O

another O
reason O

for O

dreaded O

directly O
that O

not O
the O

intention O

but O
his O
answers O
were O
at O
the O

time O
so O
vague O

equivocal O

that O
her O
mother O

often O
disheartened O

never O
yet O
despaired O
of O

soon O

by O
the O

with O

half-a-mile O

from O

lofty O

their O
furniture O

admiration O

that O

neither O

with O
less O

its O

When O
all O
of O

seen O

they O
returned O

over O

hall-door O

they O

Elizabeth PERSON
turned O
back O
to O
look O
again O
; O
her O
uncle O

aunt O
stopped O
also O
, O
and O
while O
the O
former O
was O
conjecturing O
as O
to O
the O
date O
of O
the O
building O

the O
owner O
of O
it O
himself O
suddenly O
came O
forward O
from O
the O
road O
, O
which O
led O
behind O
it O
to O
the O
stables O
. O
They O
were O
within O
twenty O
yards O
of O
each O
other O
, O
and O
so O
abrupt O
was O
his O
appearance O
, O
that O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
avoid O
his O
sight O
. O
Their O
eyes O
instantly O
met O
, O
and O
the O
cheeks O
of O
both O
were O
overspread O
with O
the O
deepest O
blush O
. O
He O
absolutely O
started O
, O
and O
for O
a O
moment O
seemed O
immovable O
from O
surprise O
; O
but O
shortly O
recovering O
himself O
, O
advanced O
towards O
the O
party O
, O
and O
spoke O
to O
Elizabeth LOCATION
, O
if O
not O
in O
terms O
of O
perfect O
composure O
, O
at O
least O
of O
perfect O
civility O

She O
had O
instinctively O
turned O
away O
; O
but O
stopping O
on O
his O
approach O
, O
received O
his O
compliments O
with O
an O
embarrassment O
impossible O
to O
be O
overcome O
. O
Had O
his O
first O
appearance O
, O
or O
his O
resemblance O
to O
the O
picture O
they O
had O
just O
been O
examining O
, O
been O
insufficient O
to O
assure O
the O
other O

Mr. PERSON

expression O

surprise O

on O
beholding O
his O
master O

must O
immediately O
have O
told O
it O
. O
They O
stood O
a O
little O
aloof O
while O
he O
was O
talking O
to O
their O
niece O
, O
who O
, O
astonished O
and O
confused O
, O
scarcely O
dared O
lift O
her O
eyes O
to O
his O
face O
, O
and O
knew O
not O
what O
answer O
she O
returned O
to O
his O
civil O
inquiries O
after O
her O
family O
. O
Amazed O
at O
the O
alteration O
of O
his O
manner O
since O
they O
last O
parted O
, O
every O
sentence O
that O
he O
uttered O
was O
increasing O
her O
embarrassment O
; O
and O
every O
idea O
of O
the O
impropriety O
of O
her O
being O
found O
there O
recurring O
to O
her O
mind O
, O
the O
few O
minutes O
in O
which O
they O
continued O
were O
some O
of O
the O
most O
uncomfortable O
in O
her O
life O
. O
Nor O
did O
he O
seem O
much O
more O
at O
ease O
; O
when O
he O
spoke O
, O
his O
accent O
had O
none O
of O
its O
usual O
sedateness O
; O
and O
he O
repeated O
his O
inquiries O
as O
to O
the O
time O
of O
her O
having O
left O
Longbourn PERSON
, O
and O
of O
her O
having O
stayed O
in O
Derbyshire LOCATION
, O
so O
often O
, O
and O
in O
so O
hurried O
a O
way O
, O
as O
plainly O
spoke O
the O
distraction O
of O
his O
thoughts O
. O
At O
length O
every O
idea O
seemed O
to O
fail O
him O
; O
and O
, O
after O
standing O
a O
few O
moments O
without O
saying O
a O
word O
, O
he O
suddenly O
recollected O
himself O
, O
and O
took O
leave O
. O
The O
others O
then O
joined O
her O
, O
and O
expressed O
admiration O
of O
his O
figure O
; O
but O
Elizabeth PERSON
heard O
not O
a O
word O
, O
and O
wholly O
engrossed O
by O
her O
own O
feelings O
, O
followed O
them O
in O
silence O
. O
She O
was O
overpowered O
by O
shame O
and O
vexation O
. O
Her O
coming O
there O
was O
the O
most O
unfortunate O
, O
the O
most O
ill-judged O
thing O
in O
the O
world O
! O
How O
strange O
it O
must O
appear O
to O
him O
! O
In O
what O
a O
disgraceful O
light O
might O
it O
not O
strike O
so O
vain O
a O
man O
! O
It O
might O
seem O
as O
if O
she O
had O
purposely O
thrown O
herself O
in O
his O
way O
again O
! O
Oh O
! O
why O
did O
she O
come O
? O
Or O
, O
why O
did O
he O
thus O
come O
a O
day O
before O
he O
was O
expected O
? O
Had O
they O
been O
only O
ten O
minutes O
sooner O
, O
they O
should O
have O
been O
beyond O
the O
reach O
of O
his O
discrimination O
; O
for O
it O
was O
plain O
that O
he O
was O
that O
moment O
arrived O
-- O
that O
moment O
alighted O
from O
his O
horse O
or O
his O
carriage O
. O
She O
blushed O
again O
and O
again O
over O
the O
perverseness O
of O
the O
meeting O
. O
And O
his O
behavior O
, O
so O
strikingly O
altered O
-- O
what O
could O
it O
mean O
? O
That O
he O
should O
even O
speak O
to O
her O
was O
amazing O
! O
-- O
but O
to O
speak O
with O
such O
civility O
, O
to O
inquire O
after O
her O
family O
! O
Never O
in O
her O
life O
had O
she O
seen O
his O
manners O
so O
little O
dignified O
, O
never O
had O
he O
spoken O
with O
such O
gentleness O
as O
on O
this O
unexpected O
meeting O
. O
What O
a O
contrast O
did O
it O
offer O
to O
his O
last O
address O
in O
Rosings LOCATION
Park LOCATION
, O
when O
he O
put O
his O
letter O
into O
her O
hand O
! O
She O
knew O
not O
what O
to O
think O
, O
or O
how O
to O
account O
for O
it O
. O
They O
had O
now O
entered O
a O
beautiful O
walk O
by O
the O
side O
of O
the O
water O
, O
and O
every O
step O
was O
bringing O
forward O
a O
nobler O
fall O
of O
ground O
, O
or O
a O
finer O
reach O
of O
the O
woods O
to O
which O
they O
were O
approaching O
; O
but O
it O
was O
some O
time O
before O
Elizabeth PERSON
was O
sensible O
of O
any O
of O
it O
; O
and O
, O
though O
she O
answered O
mechanically O
to O
the O
repeated O
appeals O
of O
her O
uncle O
and O
aunt O
, O
and O
seemed O
to O
direct O
her O
eyes O
to O
such O
objects O
as O
they O
pointed O
out O
, O
she O
distinguished O
no O
part O
of O
the O
scene O
. O
Her O
thoughts O
were O
all O
fixed O
on O
that O
one O
spot O
of O
Pemberley ORGANIZATION
House ORGANIZATION
, O
whichever O
it O
might O
be O
, O
where O
Mr. PERSON
Darcy PERSON
then O
was O
. O
She O
longed O
to O
know O
what O
at O
the O
moment O
was O
passing O
in O
his O
mind O
-- O
in O
what O
manner O
he O
thought O
of O
her O
, O
and O
whether O
, O
in O
defiance O
of O
everything O
, O
she O
was O
still O
dear O
to O
him O
. O
Perhaps O
he O
had O
been O
civil O
only O
because O
he O
felt O
himself O
at O
ease O
; O
yet O
there O
had O
been O
_ O
that O
_ O
in O
his O
voice O
which O
was O
not O
like O
ease O
. O
Whether O
he O
had O
felt O
more O
of O
pain O
or O
of O
pleasure O
in O
seeing O
her O
she O
could O
not O
tell O
, O
but O
he O
certainly O
had O
not O
seen O
her O
with O
composure O
. O
At O
length O
, O
however O
, O
the O
remarks O
of O
her O
companions O
on O
her O
absence O
of O
mind O
aroused O
her O
, O
and O
she O
felt O
the O
necessity O
of O
appearing O
more O
like O
herself O
. O
They O
entered O
the O
woods O
, O
and O
bidding O
adieu O
to O
the O
river O
for O
a O
while O
, O
ascended O
some O
of O
the O
higher O
grounds O
; O
when O
, O
in O
spots O
where O
the O
opening O
of O
the O
trees O
gave O
the O
eye O
power O
to O
wander O
, O
were O
many O
charming O
views O
of O
the O
valley O
, O
the O
opposite O
hills O
, O
with O
the O
long O
range O
of O
woods O
overspreading O
many O
, O
and O
occasionally O
part O
of O
the O
stream O
. O
Mr. PERSON
Gardiner PERSON
expressed O
a O
wish O
of O
going O
round O
the O
whole O
park O
, O
but O
feared O
it O
might O
be O
beyond O
a O
walk O
. O
With O
a O
triumphant O
smile O
they O
were O
told O
that O
it O
was O
ten O
miles O
round O
. O
It O
settled O
the O
matter O
; O
and O
they O
pursued O
the O
accustomed O
circuit O
; O
which O
brought O
them O
again O
, O
after O
some O
time O
, O
in O
a O
descent O
among O
hanging O
woods O
, O
to O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
water O
, O
and O
one O
of O
its O
narrowest O
parts O
. O
They O
crossed O
it O
by O
a O
simple O
bridge O
, O
in O
character O
with O
the O
general O
air O
of O
the O
scene O
; O
it O
was O
a O
spot O
less O
adorned O
than O
any O
they O
had O
yet O
visited O
; O
and O
the O
valley O
, O
here O
contracted O
into O
a O
glen O
, O
allowed O
room O
only O
for O
the O
stream O
, O
and O
a O
narrow O
walk O
amidst O
the O
rough O
coppice-wood O
which O
bordered O
it O
. O
Elizabeth O
longed O
to O
explore O
its O
windings O
; O
but O
when O
they O
had O
crossed O
the O
bridge O
, O
and O
perceived O
their O
distance O
from O
the O
house O
, O
Mrs. PERSON
Gardiner PERSON
, O
who O
was O
not O
a O
great O
walker O
, O
could O
go O
no O
farther O
, O
and O
thought O
only O
of O
returning O
to O
the O
carriage O
as O
quickly O
as O
possible O
. O
Her O
niece O
was O
, O
therefore O
, O
obliged O
to O
submit O
, O
and O
they O
took O
their O
way O
towards O
the O
house O
on O
the O
opposite O
side O
of O
the O
river O
, O
in O
the O
nearest O
direction O
; O
but O
their O
progress O
was O
slow O
, O
for O
Mr. PERSON
Gardiner PERSON
, O
though O
seldom O
able O
to O
indulge O
the O
taste O
, O
was O
very O
fond O
of O
fishing O
, O
and O
was O
so O
much O
engaged O
in O
watching O
the O
occasional O
appearance O
of O
some O
trout O
in O
the O
water O
, O
and O
talking O
to O
the O
man O
about O
them O
, O
that O
he O
advanced O
but O
little O
. O
Whilst O
wandering O
on O
in O
this O
slow O
manner O
, O
they O
were O
again O
surprised O
, O
and O
Elizabeth PERSON
's O
astonishment O
was O
quite O
equal O
to O
what O
it O
had O
been O
at O
first O
, O
by O
the O
sight O
of O
Mr. PERSON
Darcy PERSON
approaching O
them O
, O
and O
at O
no O
great O
distance O
. O
The O
walk O
being O
here O
less O
sheltered O
than O
on O
the O
other O
side O
, O
allowed O
them O
to O
see O
him O
before O
they O
met O
. O
Elizabeth O
, O
however O
astonished O
, O
was O
at O
least O
more O
prepared O
for O
an O
interview O
than O
before O
, O
and O
resolved O
to O
appear O
and O
to O
speak O
with O
calmness O
, O
if O
he O
really O
intended O
to O
meet O
them O
. O
For O
a O
few O
moments O
, O
indeed O
, O
she O
felt O
that O
he O
would O
probably O
strike O
into O
some O
other O
path O
. O
The O
idea O
lasted O
while O
a O
turning O
in O
the O
walk O
concealed O
him O
from O
their O
view O
; O
the O
turning O
past O
, O
he O
was O
immediately O
before O
them O
. O
With O
a O
glance O
, O
she O
saw O
that O
he O
had O
lost O
none O
of O
his O
recent O
civility O
; O
and O
, O
to O
imitate O
his O
politeness O
, O
she O
began O
, O
as O
they O
met O
, O
to O
admire O
the O
beauty O
of O
the O
place O
; O
but O
she O
had O
not O
got O
beyond O
the O
words O
`` O
delightful O
, O
'' O
and O
`` O
charming O
, O
'' O
when O
some O
unlucky O
recollections O
obtruded O
, O
and O
she O
fancied O
that O
praise O
of O
Pemberley O
from O
her O
might O
be O
mischievously O
construed O
. O
Her O
color O
changed O
, O
and O
she O
said O
no O
more O
. O
Mrs. PERSON
Gardiner PERSON
was O
standing O
a O
little O
behind O
; O
and O
on O
her O
pausing O
, O
he O
asked O
her O
if O
she O
would O
do O
him O
the O
honor O
of O
introducing O
him O
to O
her O
friends O
. O
This O
was O
a O
stroke O
of O
civility O
for O
which O
she O
was O
quite O
unprepared O
; O
and O
she O
could O
hardly O
suppress O
a O
smile O
at O
his O
being O
now O
seeking O
the O
acquaintance O
of O
some O
of O
those O
very O
people O
against O
whom O
his O
pride O
had O
revolted O
in O
his O
offer O
to O
herself O
. O
`` O
What O
will O
be O
his O
surprise O
, O
'' O
thought O
she O
, O
`` O
when O
he O
knows O
who O
they O
are O
? O
He O
takes O
them O
now O
for O
people O
of O
fashion O
. O
'' O
The O
introduction O
, O
however O
, O
was O
immediately O
made O
; O
and O
as O
she O
named O
their O
relationship O
to O
herself O
, O
she O
stole O
a O
sly O
look O
at O
him O
, O
to O
see O
how O
he O
bore O
it O
, O
and O
was O
not O
without O
the O
expectation O
of O
his O
decamping O
as O
fast O
as O
he O
could O
from O
such O
disgraceful O
companions O
. O
That O
he O
was O
_ O
surprised O
_ O
by O
the O
connection O
was O
evident O
; O
he O
sustained O
it O
, O
however O
, O
with O
fortitude O
, O
and O
so O
far O
from O
going O
away O
, O
turned O
back O
with O
them O
, O
and O
entered O
into O
conversation O
with O
Mr. PERSON
Gardiner PERSON
. O
Elizabeth O
could O
not O
but O
be O
pleased O
, O
could O
not O
but O
triumph O

It O
was O
consoling O
that O
he O
should O
know O
she O
had O
some O
relations O
for O
whom O
there O
was O
no O
need O
to O
blush O
. O
She O
listened O
most O
attentively O
to O
all O
that O
passed O
between O
them O
, O
and O
gloried O
in O
every O
expression O
, O
every O
sentence O
of O
her O
uncle O
, O
which O
marked O
his O
intelligence O
, O
his O
taste O
, O

his O
good O
manners O

The O
conversation O
soon O
turned O
upon O
fishing O
; O
and O
she O
heard O
Mr. PERSON

invite O
him O
, O
with O
the O
greatest O
civility O
, O
to O
fish O
there O
as O
often O
as O

chose O

he O
continued O
in O

offering O
at O
the O

time O
to O
supply O
him O
with O

tackle O

and O
pointing O
out O
those O
parts O

usually O
most O
sport O

Mrs. PERSON

who O

walking O
arm-in-arm O
with O

gave O
her O
a O
look O

wonder O

Elizabeth PERSON
said O
nothing O

it O
gratified O
her O
exceedingly O

the O
compliment O

be O
all O

Her O
astonishment O

was O
extreme O

walked O
on O
together O

After O
a O
short O
silence O

the O

first O
spoke O

She O
wished O
him O
to O
know O
that O

been O
assured O
of O
his O
absence O
before O
she O
came O
to O
the O
place O

and O
accordingly O
began O
by O
observing O
, O
that O
his O
arrival O
had O
been O
very O
unexpected O
-- O
`` O
for O
your O
housekeeper O

'' O
she O
added O
, O
`` O
informed O
us O
that O
you O

before O
we O
left O

we O
understood O
that O
you O

not O

expected O
in O
the O
country O

'' O
He O
acknowledged O
the O
truth O
of O
it O
all O
, O

said O
that O
business O
with O
his O
steward O
had O
occasioned O
his O
coming O
forward O
a O
few O
hours O
before O
the O
rest O
of O
the O

he O

an O
acquaintance O

Mr. PERSON
Bingley PERSON

his O
sisters O

'' O
Elizabeth O
answered O
only O
by O
a O
slight O
bow O
. O
Her O
thoughts O
were O
instantly O
driven O
back O
to O
the O
time O
when O
Mr. PERSON
Bingley PERSON
's O
name O
had O
been O
the O
last O
mentioned O
between O
them O
; O

, O
if O
she O
might O
judge O
by O
his O
complexion O
, O
_ O
his O

not O
very O
differently O
engaged O

pause O

'' O
The O
surprise O
of O
such O
an O
application O
was O
great O
indeed O
; O
it O
was O
too O
great O
for O
her O
to O
know O
in O
what O
manner O
she O
acceded O
to O
it O

She O
immediately O
felt O
that O
whatever O
desire O
Miss PERSON

might O
have O
of O
being O
acquainted O
with O
her O
must O
be O
the O
work O
of O
her O
brother O

and O
, O
without O
looking O
farther O
, O
it O
was O
satisfactory O
; O
it O
was O
gratifying O
to O
know O
that O
his O
resentment O
had O
not O
made O
him O
think O
really O
ill O
of O
her O

They O
now O
walked O
on O
in O
silence O

each O
of O
them O
deep O
in O
thought O

Elizabeth O
was O
not O
comfortable O
; O
that O
was O
impossible O
; O
but O
she O
was O
flattered O
and O
pleased O
. O
His O
wish O
of O
introducing O
his O
sister O
to O
her O
was O
a O
compliment O
of O
the O
highest O
kind O
. O
They O
soon O
outstripped O
the O
others O
, O
and O
when O
they O
had O
reached O
the O
carriage O
, O
Mr. PERSON

half O
a O
quarter O

He O
then O
asked O
her O
to O
walk O
into O
the O
house O

but O
she O
declared O
herself O
not O
tired O

they O
stood O
together O
on O
the O
lawn O

At O
such O
a O
time O
much O
might O
have O
been O
said O
, O

silence O
was O
very O
awkward O

She O
wanted O
to O
talk O
, O
but O
there O
seemed O
to O
be O
an O
embargo O
on O
every O
subject O
. O
At O
last O
she O
recollected O
that O
she O
had O
been O
traveling O

they O
talked O
of O
Matlock LOCATION

great O
perseverance O

Yet O
time O

her O

moved O
slowly O

her O
patience O

her O
ideas O
were O
nearly O
worn O
out O

over O

On O
Mr. PERSON

coming O
up O

all O
pressed O

go O
into O

some O
refreshment O

this O
was O
declined O

parted O
on O

side O

politeness O

The O
observations O
of O
her O
uncle O

now O
began O
; O
and O
each O
of O
them O
pronounced O
him O

superior O

it O

I O

more O

there O
was O
no O

But O
how O
came O
you O
to O
tell O
me O
that O
he O
was O
so O
disagreeable O

'' O
Elizabeth O
excused O
herself O
as O
well O
as O
she O
could O
; O
said O
that O
she O
had O
liked O
him O
better O
when O
they O

met O

that O

`` O
But O
perhaps O
he O
may O
be O
a O
little O
whimsical O
in O

replied O
her O
uncle O

`` O
Your O

Elizabeth O
felt O
that O

said O
nothing O

`` O

what O
we O

`` O
I O

He O
has O
not O
an O
ill-natured O

On O
the O
contrary O
, O
there O
is O
something O
pleasing O
about O
his O
mouth O
when O

And O
there O
is O
something O
of O
dignity O
in O

would O
not O
give O
one O
an O
unfavourable O
idea O

, O
to O
be O
sure O

the O
good O
lady O

give O
him O
a O
most O
flaming O

I O
could O
hardly O

laughing O
aloud O
sometimes O

he O

'' O
Elizabeth O

herself O
called O
on O
to O

something O
in O
vindication O

his O
behavior O

therefore O
gave O
them O
to O

that O
by O
what O

his O
actions O

capable O

that O

were O
now O
approaching O
the O

bring O
his O

to O
visit O
her O
the O
very O
day O
after O
her O
reaching O

was O

resolved O
not O
to O
be O
out O
of O
sight O
of O
the O
inn O
the O
whole O
of O
that O
morning O

But O
her O
conclusion O
was O
false O

for O
on O
the O
very O
morning O
after O
their O
arrival O
at O
Lambton LOCATION

these O
visitors O
came O

They O

walking O
about O

place O

some O

were O
just O
returning O

dress O
themselves O
for O
dining O

when O
the O
sound O
of O

window O

they O
saw O
a O
gentleman O

lady O
in O
a O
curricle O
driving O
up O
the O
street O

Elizabeth O
immediately O
recognizing O
the O
livery O

guessed O
what O

imparted O
no O
small O
degree O
of O
her O
surprise O

relations O
by O
acquainting O
them O
with O
the O
honor O

all O
amazement O

the O
embarrassment O

her O
manner O

spoke O

joined O
to O
the O
circumstance O
itself O

many O
of O
the O
circumstances O

the O
preceding O
day O

a O
new O
idea O
on O
the O

Nothing O

way O

accounting O
for O
such O

such O
a O
quarter O

by O

partiality O

passing O

the O
perturbation O
of O

at O
every O
moment O
increasing O

quite O
amazed O
at O
her O
own O
discomposure O

amongst O
other O
causes O

disquiet O

dreaded O
lest O

have O
said O
too O
much O
in O
her O
favor O

more O
than O
commonly O
anxious O
to O
please O

she O
naturally O
suspected O
that O
every O
power O

pleasing O

fail O
her O

She O
retreated O
from O
the O
window O

fearful O

seen O

as O
she O
walked O
up O

down O
the O
room O

endeavoring O
to O
compose O
herself O

saw O
such O
looks O

inquiring O

uncle O

made O
everything O
worse O

Miss O

appeared O

this O
formidable O
introduction O
took O
place O

With O
astonishment O
did O

see O
that O
her O

at O

as O
much O
embarrassed O

the O
observation O
of O
a O
very O
few O
minutes O
convinced O
her O
that O
she O
was O
only O
exceedingly O
shy O

She O
found O
it O
difficult O
to O
obtain O
even O
a O
word O
from O
her O
beyond O
a O
monosyllable O

Miss O
Darcy PERSON

tall O

on O
a O
larger O
scale O

little O
more O

her O
figure O

formed O

her O
appearance O
womanly O

graceful O

was O
less O

there O
was O
sense O

good O
humor O
in O
her O
face O

acute O

an O

relieved O

towards O

with O
an O
earnest O

guarded O
inquiry O

and O
they O
soon O
drew O
from O
those O
inquiries O
the O
full O
conviction O
that O
one O
of O
them O
at O
least O
knew O
what O
it O
was O
to O

Of O
the O
lady O

they O
remained O
a O
little O
in O
doubt O
; O
but O
that O
the O
gentleman O
was O
overflowing O
with O
admiration O
was O
evident O
enough O

Elizabeth O
, O
on O
her O
side O
, O
had O
much O
to O
do O
. O
She O
wanted O
to O
ascertain O
the O
feelings O
of O
each O
of O
her O
visitors O
; O
she O
wanted O
to O
compose O
her O
own O
, O
and O
to O
make O
herself O
agreeable O
to O
all O
; O
and O
in O
the O
latter O
object O
, O
where O
she O
feared O
most O
to O
fail O
, O
she O
was O
most O
sure O
of O
success O
, O
for O
those O
to O
whom O
she O
endeavored O
to O
give O
pleasure O

prepossessed O

her O
favor O

Bingley O
was O
ready O
, O
Georgiana PERSON
was O
eager O
, O
and O
Darcy PERSON
determined O
, O
to O
be O
pleased O
. O
In O
seeing O
Bingley ORGANIZATION
, O
her O
thoughts O
naturally O
flew O
to O
her O
sister O
; O
and O
, O
oh O
! O
how O
ardently O
did O
she O
long O
to O
know O
whether O
any O
of O
his O
were O
directed O
in O
a O
like O
manner O
. O
Sometimes O
she O
could O
fancy O
that O
he O
talked O
less O
than O
on O
former O
occasions O
, O
and O
once O
or O
twice O
pleased O
herself O
with O
the O
notion O
that O
, O
as O
he O
looked O
at O
her O
, O
he O
was O
trying O
to O
trace O
a O
resemblance O
. O
But O
, O
though O
this O
might O
be O
imaginary O
, O
she O
could O
not O
be O
deceived O
as O
to O
his O
behavior O
to O
Miss PERSON
Darcy PERSON
, O
who O
had O
been O
set O
up O
as O
a O
rival O
to O
Jane PERSON

No O
look O
appeared O
on O
either O
side O
that O
spoke O
particular O
regard O
. O
Nothing O
occurred O
between O
them O
that O
could O
justify O
the O
hopes O
of O
his O
sister O
. O
On O
this O
point O
she O
was O
soon O
satisfied O
; O
and O
two O
or O
three O
little O
circumstances O
occurred O
ere O
they O
parted O
, O
which O
, O
in O
her O
anxious O
interpretation O
, O
denoted O
a O
recollection O
of O
Jane PERSON
not O
untinctured O
by O
tenderness O
, O
and O
a O
wish O
of O
saying O
more O
that O
might O
lead O
to O
the O
mention O
of O
her O
, O
had O
he O
dared O
. O
He O
observed O
to O
her O
, O
at O
a O
moment O
when O
the O
others O
were O
talking O
together O
, O
and O
in O
a O
tone O
which O
had O
something O
of O
real O
regret O
, O
that O
it O
`` O
was O
a O
very O
long O
time O
since O
he O
had O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
her O
; O
'' O
and O
, O
before O
she O
could O
reply O

he O
added O
, O
`` O

Elizabeth O
was O
pleased O
to O
find O
his O
memory O
so O
exact O

he O
afterwards O
took O
occasion O
to O
ask O
her O

when O

any O

the O

whether O

was O
not O
much O
in O
the O
question O

in O
the O

remark O

there O
was O
a O
look O

a O
manner O

gave O
them O

It O
was O
not O
often O
that O
she O
could O
turn O
her O
eyes O
on O
Mr. PERSON

himself O
; O
but O
, O
whenever O
she O
did O
catch O
a O
glimpse O

she O
saw O
an O
expression O
of O
general O
complaisance O
, O

in O
all O
that O
he O
said O
she O
heard O
an O
accent O
so O
removed O
from O
_ O
hauteur O
_ O
or O
disdain O
of O
his O
companions O

as O
convinced O
her O

nothing O

Of O
Mr. PERSON

it O
was O
now O
a O
matter O
of O
anxiety O

think O
well O
; O

, O
as O
far O
as O
their O
acquaintance O
reached O

there O
was O
no O
fault O
to O
find O

They O
could O
not O
be O
untouched O
by O
his O
politeness O

had O
they O
drawn O
his O
character O
from O
their O
own O
feelings O
and O
his O
servant O

report O
, O
without O
any O
reference O
to O

account O
, O
the O
circle O
in O

to O

he O
was O
known O

not O

There O
was O
now O
an O
interest O
, O
however O
, O
in O
believing O
the O
housekeeper O
; O
and O
they O
soon O
became O
sensible O
that O
the O
authority O
of O
a O
servant O
who O
had O
known O
him O
since O
he O
was O
four O
years O
old O
, O
and O
whose O
own O
manners O
indicated O
respectability O
, O
was O
not O
to O
be O
hastily O
rejected O
. O
Neither O
had O
anything O
occurred O
in O
the O
intelligence O
of O
their O
Lambton O
friends O
that O
could O
materially O
lessen O
its O
weight O
. O
They O
had O
nothing O
to O
accuse O
him O
of O
but O
pride O
; O
pride O
he O
probably O
had O
, O
and O
if O
not O
, O
it O
would O
certainly O
be O
imputed O
by O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
a O
small O
market-town O
where O
the O
family O
did O
not O
visit O
. O
It O
was O
acknowledged O
, O
however O
, O
that O
he O
was O
a O
liberal O
man O
, O
and O
did O
much O
good O
among O
the O
poor O
. O
With O
respect O
to O
Wickham PERSON
, O
the O
travellers O
soon O
found O
that O
he O
was O
not O
held O
there O
in O
much O
estimation O
; O
for O
though O
the O
chief O
of O
his O
concerns O
with O
the O
son O
of O
his O
patron O
were O
imperfectly O
understood O
, O
it O
was O
yet O
a O
well-known O
fact O
that O
, O
on O
his O
quitting O
Derbyshire LOCATION
, O
he O
had O
left O
many O
debts O
behind O
him O
, O
which O
Mr. PERSON
Darcy PERSON
afterwards O
discharged O
. O
As O
for O
Elizabeth PERSON
, O
her O
thoughts O
were O
at O
Pemberley LOCATION
this TIME
evening TIME
more O
than O
the O
last O
; O
and O
the O
evening TIME
, O
though O
as O
it O
passed O
it O
seemed O
long O
, O
was O
not O
long O
enough O
to O
determine O
her O
feelings O
towards O
_ O
one O
_ O
in O
that O
mansion O
; O
and O
she O
lay O
awake O
two O
whole O
hours O
endeavoring O
to O
make O
them O
out O
. O
She O
certainly O
did O
not O
hate O
him O
. O
No O
; O
hatred O
had O
vanished O
long O
ago O
, O
and O
she O
had O
almost O
as O
long O
been O
ashamed O
of O
ever O
feeling O
a O
dislike O
against O
him O
, O
that O
could O
be O
so O
called O
. O
The O
respect O
created O
by O
the O
conviction O
of O
his O
valuable O
qualities O
, O
though O
at O
first O
unwillingly O
admitted O
, O
had O
for O
some O
time O
ceased O
to O
be O
repugnant O
to O
her O
feeling O
; O
and O
it O
was O
now O
heightened O
into O
somewhat O
of O
a O
friendlier O
nature O
, O
by O
the O
testimony O
so O
highly O
in O
his O
favor O
, O
and O
bringing O
forward O
his O
disposition O
in O
so O
amiable O
a O
light O
, O
which O
yesterday O
had O
produced O
. O
But O
above O
all O
, O
above O
respect O
and O
esteem O
, O
there O
was O
a O
motive O
within O
her O
of O
goodwill O
which O
could O
not O
be O
overlooked O
. O
It O
was O
gratitude O
; O
gratitude O
, O
not O
merely O
for O
having O
once O
loved O
her O
, O
but O
for O
loving O
her O
still O
well O
enough O
to O
forgive O
all O
the O
petulance O
and O
acrimony O
of O
her O
manner O
in O
rejecting O
him O
, O
and O
all O
the O
unjust O
accusations O
accompanying O
her O
rejection O
. O
He O
who O
, O
she O
had O
been O
persuaded O
, O
would O
avoid O
her O
as O
his O
greatest O
enemy O
, O
seemed O
, O
on O
this O
accidental O
meeting O
, O
most O
eager O
to O
preserve O
the O
acquaintance O
, O
and O
without O
any O
indelicate O
display O
of O
regard O
, O
or O
any O
peculiarity O
of O
manner O
, O
where O
their O
two O
selves O
only O
were O
concerned O
, O
was O
soliciting O
the O
good O
opinion O
of O
her O
friends O
, O
and O
bent O
on O
making O
her O
known O
to O
his O
sister O
. O
Such O
a O
change O
in O
a O
man O
of O
so O
much O
pride O
exciting O
not O
only O
astonishment O
but O
gratitude O
-- O
for O
to O
love O
, O
ardent O
love O
, O
it O
must O
be O
attributed O
; O
and O
as O
such O
its O
impression O
on O
her O
was O
of O
a O
sort O
to O
be O
encouraged O
, O
as O
by O
no O
means O
unpleasing O
, O
though O
it O
could O
not O
be O
exactly O
defined O
. O
She O
respected O
, O
she O
esteemed O
, O
she O
was O
grateful O
to O
him O
, O
she O
felt O
a O
real O
interest O
in O
his O
welfare O
; O
and O
she O
only O
wanted O
to O
know O
how O
far O
she O
wished O
that O
welfare O
to O
depend O
upon O
herself O
, O
and O
how O
far O
it O
would O
be O
for O
the O
happiness O
of O
both O
that O
she O
should O
employ O
the O
power O

which O
her O
fancy O
told O
her O

still O
possessed O

of O
bringing O
on O
her O
the O

that O

a O
genteel O

a O
short O

that O

she O

not O
sorry O

spared O
the O
necessity O
of O
saying O
much O

Her O
own O

were O
employing O

She O
expected O
every O
moment O
that O
some O
of O

enter O

wished O

she O

whether O

this O
manner O
a O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour O
without O

Miss O

roused O
by O
receiving O
from O

cold O
inquiry O

She O
answered O

equal O
indifference O

brevity O

the O

no O

The O
next O
variation O

produced O
by O

by O
the O

a O
moment O

the O
more O
necessary O
to O
be O
made O
, O
but O
perhaps O
not O
the O
more O
easily O
kept O

because O
she O
saw O
that O
the O
suspicions O
of O

awakened O
against O

that O

that O
his O

'' O
Darcy O
made O
no O

He O
seemed O
scarcely O
to O
hear O
her O

was O
walking O
up O

down O
the O
room O
in O
earnest O
meditation O

his O
brow O
contracted O

his O
air O
gloomy O

Elizabeth O
soon O
observed O
, O
and O
instantly O
understood O
it O
. O
Her O
power O
was O
sinking O
; O
everything O
_ O
must O
_ O
sink O
under O
such O
a O
proof O
of O
family O
weakness O
, O
such O
an O
assurance O
of O
the O
deepest O
disgrace O
. O
She O
could O
neither O
wonder O
nor O
condemn O
, O
but O
the O
belief O
of O
his O
self-conquest O
brought O
nothing O
consolatory O
to O
her O
bosom O
, O
afforded O
no O
palliation O
of O
her O
distress O
. O
It O
was O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
exactly O
calculated O
to O
make O
her O
understand O
her O
own O
wishes O
; O
and O
never O
had O
she O
so O
honestly O
felt O
that O
she O
could O
have O
loved O
him O
, O
as O
now O
, O
when O
all O
love O
must O
be O
vain O

self O

it O
would O
intrude O

not O

Lydia O

the O
humiliation O

the O
misery O

was O
bringing O
on O

all O

swallowed O
up O

covering O
her O

with O
her O
handkerchief O

Elizabeth PERSON
was O
soon O
lost O
to O
everything O
else O
; O
and O
, O
after O
a O
pause O
of O
several O
minutes O
, O
was O
only O
recalled O
to O
a O
sense O
of O
her O
situation O
by O
the O
voice O
of O
her O
companion O

who O
, O
in O
a O
manner O
which O
, O
though O
it O
spoke O
compassion O

spoke O
likewise O

said O

He O
readily O
assured O
her O

again O
expressed O
his O
sorrow O

wished O

away O

As O
he O
quitted O

Elizabeth PERSON
felt O
how O
improbable O
it O
was O
that O
they O
should O
ever O
see O
each O
other O
again O
on O
such O
terms O
of O
cordiality O
as O
had O
marked O
their O
several O
meetings O
in O
Derbyshire LOCATION
; O
and O
as O
she O
threw O
a O
retrospective O
glance O
over O
the O
whole O
of O
their O
acquaintance O
, O
so O
full O
of O
contradictions O
and O
varieties O
, O
sighed O
at O
the O
perverseness O
of O
those O
feelings O
which O
would O
now O
have O
promoted O
its O
continuance O
, O
and O
would O
formerly O
have O
rejoiced O
in O
its O
termination O

If O
gratitude O
and O
esteem O
are O
good O
foundations O
of O
affection O
, O
Elizabeth PERSON
's O
change O
of O
sentiment O
will O
be O
neither O
improbable O
nor O
faulty O
. O
But O
if O
otherwise O
-- O
if O
regard O
springing O
from O
such O
sources O
is O
unreasonable O
or O
unnatural O
, O
in O
comparison O
of O
what O
is O
so O
often O
described O
as O
arising O
on O
a O
first O
interview O
with O
its O
object O
, O
and O
even O
before O
two O
words O
have O
been O
exchanged O
, O
nothing O
can O
be O
said O
in O
her O
defense O
, O
except O
that O
she O
had O
given O
somewhat O
of O
a O
trial O
to O
the O
latter O
method O
in O
her O
partiality O
for O
Wickham PERSON
, O
and O
that O
its O
ill O
success O
might O
, O
perhaps O
, O
authorise O
her O
to O
seek O
the O
other O
less O
interesting O
mode O
of O
attachment O
. O
Be O
that O
as O
it O
may O
, O
she O
saw O
him O
go O
with O
regret O
; O
and O
in O
this O
early O
example O
of O
what O
Lydia PERSON
's O
infamy O
must O
produce O
, O
found O
additional O
anguish O
as O
she O
reflected O
on O
that O
wretched O
business O

Never O
, O
since O
reading O
Jane PERSON
's O
second O
letter O
, O
had O
she O
entertained O
a O
hope O
of O
Wickham PERSON

meaning O
to O
marry O
her O
. O
No O
one O
but O
Jane PERSON
, O
she O
thought O
, O
could O
flatter O
herself O
with O
such O
an O
expectation O
. O
Surprise O
was O
the O
least O
of O
her O
feelings O
on O
this O
development O
. O
While O
the O
contents O
of O
the O
first O
letter O
remained O
in O
her O
mind O
, O
she O
was O
all O
surprise O

all O
astonishment O
that O
Wickham PERSON
should O
marry O
a O
girl O
whom O
it O
was O
impossible O
he O
could O
marry O
for O
money O
; O
and O
how O
Lydia PERSON
could O
ever O
have O
attached O
him O
had O
appeared O
incomprehensible O
. O
But O
now O
it O
was O
all O
too O
natural O
. O
For O
such O
an O
attachment O
as O
this O
she O
might O
have O
sufficient O
charms O
; O
and O
though O
she O
did O
not O
suppose O
Lydia PERSON
to O
be O
deliberately O
engaging O
in O
an O
elopement O
without O
the O
intention O
of O
marriage O
, O
she O
had O
no O
difficulty O
in O
believing O
that O
neither O
her O
virtue O
nor O
her O
understanding O
would O
preserve O
her O
from O
falling O
an O
easy O
prey O
. O
She O
had O
never O
perceived O

while O
the O
regiment O
was O
in O
Hertfordshire LOCATION
, O
that O
Lydia PERSON
had O
any O
partiality O
for O
him O
; O
but O
she O
was O
convinced O
that O
Lydia PERSON
wanted O
only O
encouragement O
to O
attach O
herself O
to O
anybody O
. O
Sometimes O
one O
officer O
, O
sometimes O
another O

had O
been O
her O
favorite O
, O
as O
their O
attentions O
raised O
them O
in O
her O
opinion O

Her O
affections O
had O
continually O
been O
fluctuating O

never O
without O
an O
object O

The O
mischief O
of O
neglect O

mistaken O
indulgence O
towards O
such O
a O
girl O
-- O
oh O
! O
how O
acutely O
did O
she O
now O
feel O
it O

was O
wild O

upon O
the O
spot O

the O
cares O
that O

now O

wholly O
upon O

though O
almost O
persuaded O
that O
nothing O

be O
done O
for O
Lydia PERSON

her O
uncle O

of O
the O

till O
he O
entered O
the O
room O

severe O

taken O
suddenly O

letters O
aloud O

on O

persuaded O
that O

no O

such O
a O
seclusion O
from O

did O
not O

enough O
to O
hold O
her O
tongue O
before O
the O
servants O

they O
waited O
at O

judged O
it O
better O
that O

of O

the O
one O

came O
from O

from O

The O
faces O
of O
both O

were O
tolerably O
calm O
; O

no O
change O
was O
visible O
in O
either O

except O
that O
the O
loss O

favorite O
sister O

or O
the O
anger O
which O
she O
had O
herself O
incurred O
in O
this O
business O
, O
had O
given O
more O
of O
fretfulness O
than O
usual O
to O
the O
accents O
of O
Kitty O

As O
for O
Mary PERSON
, O
she O
was O
mistress O
enough O
of O
herself O
to O
whisper O
to O
Elizabeth LOCATION

with O
a O
countenance O
of O
grave O
reflection O
, O
soon O
after O
they O
were O
seated O
at O
table O
: O
`` O

added O

the O
event O
must O
be O
for O

may O
draw O
from O
it O
this O
useful O
lesson O
: O
that O
loss O
of O
virtue O
in O
a O
female O
is O
irretrievable O
; O
that O
one O
false O
step O

is O
no O

that O
she O
can O
not O

guarded O
in O
her O
behavior O
towards O
the O
undeserving O
of O
the O

'' O
Elizabeth O
lifted O
up O
her O
eyes O
in O
amazement O
, O
but O
was O
too O
much O
oppressed O
to O
make O
any O
reply O

Mary O
, O
however O
, O
continued O
to O
console O
herself O
with O
such O
kind O
of O
moral O
extractions O
from O
the O
evil O
before O
them O

In O
the O
afternoon O

the O
two O

able O
to O
be O
for O
half-an-hour O

herself O

the O
opportunity O

any O
inquiries O

equally O

now O
a O
day O

the O
most O
afflicting O
to O
a O
parent O

The O
death O
of O
your O

have O
been O
a O
blessing O
in O
comparison O
of O
this O

it O
is O
the O
more O
to O
be O
lamented O

there O
is O
reason O
to O
suppose O

my O

me O

that O
this O
licentiousness O
of O

proceeded O

degree O

indulgence O

at O
the O

time O
, O
for O
the O
consolation O
of O
yourself O

Mrs. PERSON
Bennet PERSON

I O
am O
inclined O
to O
think O
that O
her O

be O
naturally O
bad O

she O
could O

grievously O

opinion O
I O
am O
not O

likewise O
by O
Lady O
Catherine PERSON

her O
daughter O

to O
whom O
I O
have O
related O
the O
affair O

They O
agree O
with O
me O
in O
apprehending O
that O
this O
false O
step O
in O
one O

will O
be O
injurious O
to O
the O

condescendingly O
says O
, O
will O
connect O
themselves O

such O

this O
consideration O
leads O

her O
through O
her O
mother O

hands O

Lydia PERSON
's O
expenses O
had O
been O
very O
little O
within O
that O
sum O

That O
it O
would O
be O
done O
with O
such O
trifling O
exertion O
on O
his O
side O
, O
too O
, O
was O
another O
very O
welcome O
surprise O
; O
for O
his O
wish O
at O
present O
was O
to O
have O
as O
little O
trouble O
in O
the O
business O
as O
possible O
. O
When O
the O
first O
transports O
of O
rage O
which O
had O
produced O
his O
activity O
in O
seeking O
her O
were O
over O
, O
he O
naturally O
returned O
to O
all O
his O
former O
indolence O
. O
His O
letter O
was O
soon O
dispatched O
; O
for O
, O
though O
dilatory O
in O
undertaking O
business O
, O
he O
was O
quick O
in O
its O
execution O
. O
He O
begged O
to O
know O
further O
particulars O
of O
what O
he O
was O
indebted O
to O
his O
brother O
, O
but O
was O
too O
angry O
with O
Lydia PERSON
to O
send O
any O
message O
to O
her O
. O
The O
good O
news O
spread O
quickly O
through O
the O
house O
, O
and O
with O
proportionate O
speed O
through O
the O
neighborhood O
. O
It O
was O
borne O
in O
the O
latter O
with O
decent O
philosophy O
. O
To O
be O
sure O
, O
it O
would O
have O
been O
more O
for O
the O
advantage O
of O
conversation O
had O
Miss O
Lydia PERSON
Bennet PERSON
come O
upon O
the O
town O
; O
or O
, O
as O
the O
happiest O
alternative O
, O
been O
secluded O
from O
the O
world O
, O
in O
some O
distant O
farmhouse O
. O
But O
there O
was O
much O
to O
be O
talked O
of O
in O
marrying O
her O
; O
and O
the O
good-natured O
wishes O
for O
her O
well-doing O
which O
had O
proceeded O
before O
from O
all O
the O
spiteful O
old O
ladies O
in O
Meryton O
lost O
but O
a O
little O
of O
their O
spirit O
in O
this O
change O
of O
circumstances O
, O
because O
with O
such O
an O
husband O
her O
misery O
was O
considered O
certain O
. O
It O
was O
a O
fortnight O
since O
Mrs. PERSON
Bennet PERSON
had O
been O
downstairs O
; O
but O
on O
this O
happy O
day O
she O
again O
took O
her O
seat O
at O
the O
head O
of O
her O
table O
, O
and O
in O
spirits O
oppressively O
high O
. O
No O
sentiment O
of O
shame O
gave O
a O
damp O
to O
her O
triumph O
. O
The O
marriage O
of O
a O
daughter O
, O
which O
had O
been O
the O
first O
object O
of O
her O
wishes O
since O
Jane PERSON
was O
sixteen O
, O
was O
now O
on O
the O
point O
of O
accomplishment O
, O
and O
her O
thoughts O
and O
her O
words O
ran O
wholly O
on O
those O
attendants O
of O
elegant O
nuptials O
, O
fine O
muslins O
, O
new O
carriages O
, O
and O
servants O
. O
She O
was O
busily O
searching O
through O
the O
neighborhood O
for O
a O
proper O
situation O
for O
her O
daughter O
, O
and O
, O
without O
knowing O
or O
considering O
what O
their O
income O
might O
be O
, O
rejected O
many O
as O
deficient O
in O
size O
and O
importance O
. O
`` O

said O
she O
, O
`` O
if O

far O
off O

her O
ten O

Pulvis ORGANIZATION

'' O
Her O
husband O
allowed O
her O
to O
talk O
on O
without O
interruption O
while O
the O
servants O
remained O
. O
But O
when O
they O
had O
withdrawn O
, O
he O
said O
to O
her O
: O
`` O
Mrs. PERSON

before O

any O

never O

I O
will O
not O
encourage O
the O
impudence O
of O
either O
, O
by O
receiving O
them O
at O
Longbourn O
. O
'' O
A O
long O
dispute O
followed O
this O
declaration O
; O
but O
Mr. PERSON
Bennet PERSON
was O
firm O
. O
It O
soon O
led O
to O
another O
; O
and O
Mrs. PERSON
Bennet PERSON
found O
, O
with O
amazement O
and O
horror O
, O
that O
her O
husband O
would O
not O
advance O
a O
guinea O
to O
buy O
clothes O
for O
his O
daughter O
. O
He O
protested O
that O
she O
should O
receive O
from O
him O
no O
mark O
of O
affection O
whatever O
on O
the O
occasion O
. O
Mrs. PERSON
Bennet PERSON
could O
hardly O
comprehend O
it O
. O
That O
his O
anger O
could O
be O
carried O
to O
such O
a O
point O
of O
inconceivable O
resentment O
as O
to O
refuse O
his O
daughter O
a O
privilege O
without O
which O
her O
marriage O
would O
scarcely O
seem O
valid O
, O
exceeded O
all O
she O
could O
believe O
possible O
. O
She O
was O
more O
alive O
to O
the O
disgrace O
which O
her O
want O
of O
new O
clothes O
must O
reflect O
on O
her O
daughter O
's O
nuptials O
, O
than O
to O
any O
sense O
of O
shame O
at O
her O
eloping O
and O
living O
with O
Wickham PERSON
a O
fortnight O
before O
they O
took O
place O
. O
Elizabeth O
was O
now O
most O
heartily O
sorry O
that O
she O
had O
, O
from O
the O
distress O
of O
the O
moment O
, O
been O
led O
to O
make O
Mr. PERSON
Darcy PERSON
acquainted O
with O
their O
fears O
for O
her O
sister O
; O
for O
since O
her O
marriage O
would O
so O
shortly O
give O
the O
proper O
termination O
to O
the O
elopement O
, O
they O
might O
hope O
to O
conceal O
its O
unfavourable O
beginning O
from O
all O
those O
who O
were O
not O
immediately O
on O
the O
spot O
. O
She O
had O
no O
fear O
of O
its O
spreading O
farther O
through O
his O
means O
. O
There O
were O
few O
people O
on O
whose O
secrecy O
she O
would O
have O
more O
confidently O
depended O
; O
but O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
there O
was O
no O
one O
whose O
knowledge O
of O
a O
sister O
's O
frailty O
would O
have O
mortified O
her O
so O
much O
-- O
not O
, O
however O
, O
from O
any O
fear O
of O
disadvantage O
from O
it O
individually O
to O
herself O
, O
for O
, O
at O
any O
rate O
, O
there O
seemed O
a O
gulf O
impassable O
between O
them O
. O
Had O
Lydia PERSON
's O
marriage O
been O
concluded O
on O
the O
most O
honorable O
terms O
, O
it O
was O
not O
to O
be O
supposed O
that O
Mr. PERSON
Darcy PERSON
would O
connect O
himself O
with O
a O
family O
where O
, O
to O
every O
other O
objection O
, O
would O
now O
be O
added O
an O
alliance O
and O
relationship O
of O
the O
nearest O
kind O
with O
a O
man O
whom O
he O
so O
justly O
scorned O
. O
From O
such O
a O
connection O
she O
could O
not O
wonder O
that O
he O
would O
shrink O
. O
The O
wish O
of O
procuring O
her O
regard O
, O
which O
she O
had O
assured O
herself O
of O
his O
feeling O
in O
Derbyshire LOCATION
, O
could O
not O
in O
rational O
expectation O
survive O
such O
a O
blow O
as O
this O
. O
She O
was O
humbled O
, O
she O
was O
grieved O
; O
she O
repented O
, O
though O
she O
hardly O
knew O
of O
what O
. O
She O
became O
jealous O
of O
his O
esteem O
, O
when O
she O
could O
no O
longer O
hope O
to O
be O
benefited O
by O
it O
. O
She O
wanted O
to O
hear O
of O
him O
, O
when O
there O
seemed O
the O
least O
chance O
of O
gaining O
intelligence O
. O
She O
was O
convinced O
that O
she O
could O
have O
been O
happy O
with O
him O
, O
when O
it O
was O
no O
longer O
likely O
they O
should O
meet O
. O
What O
a O
triumph O
for O
him O
, O
as O
she O
often O
thought O
, O
could O
he O
know O
that O
the O
proposals O
which O
she O
had O
proudly O
spurned O
only O
four O
months O
ago O
, O
would O
now O
have O
been O
most O
gladly O
and O
gratefully O
received O
! O
He O
was O
as O
generous O
, O
she O
doubted O
not O
, O
as O
the O
most O
generous O
of O
his O
sex O
; O
but O
while O
he O
was O
mortal O
, O
there O
must O
be O
a O
triumph O
. O
She O
began O
now O
to O
comprehend O
that O
he O
was O
exactly O
the O
man O
who O
, O
in O
disposition O
and O
talents O
, O
would O
most O
suit O
her O
. O
His O
understanding O
and O
temper O
, O
though O
unlike O
her O
own O
, O
would O
have O
answered O
all O
her O
wishes O
. O
It O
was O
an O
union O
that O
must O
have O
been O
to O
the O
advantage O
of O
both O
; O
by O
her O
ease O
and O
liveliness O
, O
his O
mind O
might O
have O
been O
softened O
, O
his O
manners O
improved O
; O
and O
from O
his O
judgement O
, O
information O
, O
and O
knowledge O
of O
the O
world O
, O
she O
must O
have O
received O
benefit O
of O
greater O
importance O
. O
But O
no O
such O
happy O
marriage O
could O
now O
teach O
the O
admiring O
multitude O
what O
connubial O
felicity O
really O
was O
. O
An O
union O
of O
a O
different O
tendency O
, O
and O
precluding O
the O
possibility O
of O
the O
other O
, O
was O
soon O
to O
be O
formed O
in O
their O
family O
. O
How O
Wickham PERSON
and O
Lydia PERSON
were O
to O
be O
supported O
in O
tolerable O
independence O
, O
she O
could O
not O
imagine O
. O
But O
how O
little O
of O
permanent O
happiness O
could O
belong O
to O
a O
couple O
who O
were O
only O
brought O
together O
because O
their O
passions O
were O
stronger O
than O
their O
virtue O
, O
she O
could O
easily O
conjecture O
. O

Mr. PERSON
Gardiner PERSON
soon O
wrote O
again O
to O
his O
brother O
. O
To O
Mr. PERSON
Bennet PERSON
's O
acknowledgments O

briefly O
replied O
, O
with O
assurance O
of O
his O
eagerness O
to O
promote O
the O
welfare O
of O
any O
of O
his O
family O
; O
and O
concluded O
with O
entreaties O
that O
the O
subject O
might O
never O
be O
mentioned O
to O
him O
again O
. O
The O
principal O
purport O
of O
his O
letter O
was O
to O
inform O
them O
that O
Mr. PERSON
Wickham PERSON
had O
resolved O
on O
quitting O
the O
militia O
. O
`` O
It O
was O
greatly O
my O
wish O
that O

should O
do O
so O

'' O
he O
added O
, O
`` O
as O
soon O

was O
fixed O

I O
think O
you O
will O
agree O
with O
me O

in O
considering O
the O
removal O

highly O
advisable O

both O
on O
his O
account O

my O

Mr. PERSON

intention O
to O

an O
ensigncy O

have O
a O
character O

will O

more O

Jane PERSON
more O

, O
who O
gave O
Lydia PERSON
the O
feelings O
which O

have O
attended O
herself O
, O
had O
she O
been O
the O
culprit O
, O
and O

wretched O
in O
the O

of O
what O

endure O

They O
came O

The O

her O

impenetrably O
grave O

her O

alarmed O

Lydia O

voice O

in O

into O

Wickham PERSON

who O
followed O

wished O
them O
both O
joy O
with O
an O
alacrity O

no O

Their O
reception O
from O
Mr. PERSON
Bennet PERSON
, O
to O
whom O
they O
then O
turned O
, O
was O
not O
quite O
so O
cordial O
. O
His O
countenance O
rather O
gained O
in O
austerity O
; O
and O
he O
scarcely O
opened O
his O
lips O
. O
The O
easy O
assurance O
of O
the O
young O
couple O
, O
indeed O
, O
was O
enough O
to O
provoke O
him O
. O
Elizabeth O
was O
disgusted O
, O
and O
even O
Miss O
Bennet PERSON
was O
shocked O
. O
Lydia PERSON
was O
Lydia PERSON
still O
; O
untamed O

unabashed O
, O
wild O

noisy O

fearless O

She O
turned O
from O
sister O
to O
sister O
, O
demanding O
their O
congratulations O
; O
and O
when O
at O
length O
they O
all O
sat O
down O
, O
looked O
eagerly O
round O
the O
room O
, O
took O
notice O
of O
some O
little O
alteration O
in O
it O
, O
and O
observed O
, O
with O
a O
laugh O
, O
that O
it O
was O
a O
great O
while O
since O
she O
had O
been O
there O
. O
Wickham PERSON
was O
not O
at O
all O
more O
distressed O
than O
herself O
, O
but O
his O
manners O
were O
always O
so O
pleasing O
, O
that O
had O
his O
character O
and O
his O
marriage O
been O
exactly O
what O
they O
ought O
, O
his O
smiles O
and O
his O
easy O
address O
, O
while O
he O
claimed O
their O
relationship O
, O
would O
have O
delighted O
them O
all O

Elizabeth O
had O
not O
before O
believed O
him O
quite O
equal O
to O
such O
assurance O
; O
but O
she O
sat O
down O
, O
resolving O
within O
herself O
to O
draw O
no O
limits O
in O
future O
to O
the O
impudence O
of O
an O
impudent O
man O
. O
She O
blushed O
, O
and O
Jane PERSON
blushed O
; O
but O
the O
cheeks O
of O
the O
two O
who O
caused O
their O
confusion O
suffered O
no O
variation O
of O
color O

There O
was O
no O
want O
of O
discourse O
. O
The O
bride O
and O
her O
mother O
could O
neither O
of O
them O
talk O
fast O
enough O
; O
and O
Wickham PERSON
, O
who O
happened O
to O
sit O
near O
Elizabeth LOCATION
, O
began O
inquiring O
after O
his O
acquaintance O
in O
that O
neighborhood O
, O
with O
a O
good O
humored O
ease O
which O
she O
felt O
very O
unable O
to O
equal O
in O
her O
replies O

They O
seemed O
each O
of O
them O
to O
have O
the O
happiest O
memories O
in O
the O
world O
. O
Nothing O
of O
the O
past O
was O
recollected O
with O
pain O
; O

Lydia PERSON
led O
voluntarily O
to O
subjects O
which O
her O
sisters O
would O
not O
have O
alluded O
to O
for O
the O
world O

`` O

his O
curricle O

I O
let O
down O

off O

let O

upon O

for O

She O
had O
scarcely O
needed O
her O
present O
observation O

be O
satisfied O

from O
the O
reason O

that O

been O
brought O
on O
by O
the O
strength O

rather O

by O

However O

I O
did O
not O

above O
one O

I O
was O
thinking O

you O
may O
suppose O

of O

I O
longed O

we O
breakfasted O

by O

you O

that O

believe O
me O

I O
did O
not O
once O
put O
my O

so O
just O
as O

shut O
up O

several O

was O
all O

my O

dreadfully O

From O
what O

he O
left O

only O
one O
day O
after O
ourselves O

and O
came O
to O
town O
with O
the O
resolution O
of O
hunting O
for O
them O

The O
motive O
professed O
was O
his O
conviction O
of O
its O
being O
owing O
to O
himself O
that O
Wickham PERSON
's O
worthlessness O
had O
not O
been O
so O
well O
known O

to O
make O
it O
impossible O
for O
any O
young O
woman O
of O
character O
to O
love O
or O
confide O
in O
him O
. O
He O
generously O
imputed O
the O
whole O
to O
his O
mistaken O
pride O

confessed O
that O
he O
had O
before O
thought O
it O
beneath O
him O
to O
lay O
his O
private O
actions O
open O
to O
the O

His O
character O
was O
to O

called O

his O

I O

never O

some O
days O

was O
able O
to O
discover O
them O

he O
had O
something O
to O
direct O
his O
search O

which O
was O
more O
than O
_ O
we O
_ O
had O
; O
and O
the O
consciousness O

this O
was O
another O
reason O

, O
in O

conversation O
with O

he O
easily O
learned O

I O

above O

It O
was O
owing O
to O
him O

to O
his O
reserve O

want O
of O
proper O
consideration O

that O
Wickham PERSON

character O
had O
been O
so O
misunderstood O

consequently O
that O
he O
had O
been O
received O

noticed O

was O

Perhaps O
there O
was O
some O
truth O
in O

this O

I O
doubt O
whether O
_ O
his O
_ O

anybody O

can O
be O
answerable O

The O

threw O

into O
a O
flutter O
of O
spirits O

in O
which O
it O
was O
difficult O

determine O
whether O
pleasure O

the O

The O

in O
which O
supplication O

a O

the O

whose O

punishment O

all O

heart O

whisper O

But O
it O
was O
a O
hope O
shortly O
checked O
by O
other O
considerations O

she O
soon O
felt O
that O
even O
her O
vanity O
was O
insufficient O
, O
when O
required O
to O
depend O
on O
his O
affection O
for O
her O

for O
a O
woman O
who O
had O
already O
refused O
him O

, O
to O
be O
sure O

done O
much O

She O
was O
ashamed O
to O
think O
how O
much O

But O
he O
had O
given O
a O
reason O
for O
his O
interference O

which O
asked O
no O
extraordinary O
stretch O
of O
belief O

It O
was O
reasonable O
that O
he O
should O
feel O
he O
had O
been O
wrong O

he O
had O
liberality O

he O
had O
the O
means O

exercising O
it O
; O
and O
though O
she O
would O
not O
place O
herself O
as O
his O
principal O
inducement O
, O
she O
could O
, O
perhaps O
, O
believe O
that O
remaining O
partiality O

might O
assist O
his O
endeavors O
in O
a O
cause O
where O
her O
peace O

concerned O

It O
was O
painful O
, O
exceedingly O
painful O
, O
to O
know O
that O
they O
were O
under O
obligations O
to O
a O
person O
who O
could O
never O
receive O
a O

They O
owed O
the O
restoration O
of O
Lydia LOCATION

her O
character O

every O
thing O

to O
him O

Oh O
! O
how O
heartily O
did O

grieve O
over O
every O
ungracious O

had O
ever O
encouraged O
, O
every O
saucy O
speech O

ever O
directed O

him O

For O
herself O
she O
was O
humbled O

she O
was O
proud O
of O
him O

Proud O
that O
in O
a O
cause O
of O
compassion O

honor O

he O
had O
been O
able O

get O
the O
better O

She O
read O
over O
her O
aunt O

commendation O
of O
him O
again O

again O

It O
was O
hardly O
enough O

it O
pleased O
her O

She O
was O
even O
sensible O
of O
some O
pleasure O

though O
mixed O
with O
regret O

on O
finding O
how O
steadfastly O
both O
she O

her O
uncle O
had O
been O
persuaded O
that O
affection O

confidence O
subsisted O
between O

was O
roused O
from O

by O
some O
one O

an O

glow O

to O

more O
sedate O

Elizabeth PERSON

equally O
free O
from O

Elizabeth PERSON
said O
as O
little O
to O
either O

civility O

allow O

sat O
down O
again O
to O
her O
work O
, O
with O
an O
eagerness O
which O
it O
did O
not O
often O
command O

She O
had O
ventured O
only O
one O
glance O
at O
Darcy LOCATION

He O
looked O
serious O
, O
as O
usual O
; O
and O
, O
she O
thought O
, O
more O
as O
he O
had O
been O
used O
to O
look O
in O
Hertfordshire LOCATION

than O
as O
she O
had O
seen O
him O
at O
Pemberley LOCATION

But O
, O
perhaps O
he O
could O
not O
in O
her O
mother O
's O
presence O
be O
what O
he O
was O
before O
her O
uncle O

It O
was O
a O
painful O

not O
an O
improbable O

conjecture O

Bingley O
, O
she O
had O
likewise O
seen O
for O
an O
instant O

in O
that O
short O
period O
saw O
him O
looking O
both O
pleased O

embarrassed O

He O
was O
received O
by O
Mrs. PERSON
Bennet PERSON
with O
a O
degree O
of O
civility O
which O
made O
her O
two O
daughters O
ashamed O
, O
especially O
when O
contrasted O
with O
the O
cold O
and O
ceremonious O
politeness O
of O
her O
curtsey O
and O
address O
to O
his O
friend O

Elizabeth O
, O
particularly O
, O
who O
knew O
that O
her O

to O
the O

the O
preservation O
of O
her O
favorite O
daughter O
from O
irremediable O
infamy O
, O
was O
hurt O

distressed O
to O
a O
most O
painful O
degree O
by O
a O
distinction O
so O
ill O
applied O

Darcy O
, O
after O
inquiring O
of O
her O
how O
Mr. O

Gardiner PERSON
did O
, O
a O
question O
which O
she O
could O
not O
answer O
without O
confusion O
, O
said O
scarcely O
anything O
. O
He O
was O
not O
seated O
by O
her O
; O
perhaps O
that O
was O
the O
reason O
of O
his O
silence O
; O
but O
it O
had O
not O
been O
so O
in O

he O

now O
several O

the O
impulse O
of O
curiosity O

she O
raised O
her O
eyes O

his O

she O

His O
behavior O

such O

during O
dinner O
time O

as O
showed O
an O
admiration O
of O
her O

more O

she O
yet O
received O
pleasure O
from O

his O
behavior O

It O
gave O
her O
all O
the O
animation O
that O

boast O

she O
was O
in O
no O

Mr. PERSON

was O
almost O

far O
from O

He O
was O
on O
one O
side O
of O

knew O
how O
little O
such O
a O
situation O
would O
give O
pleasure O
to O
either O

to O
advantage O

She O
was O
not O
near O
enough O
to O
hear O
any O
of O
their O
discourse O

she O
could O
see O
how O
seldom O
they O
spoke O
to O
each O
other O

and O
how O
formal O
and O
cold O
was O
their O
manner O
whenever O
they O
did O
. O
Her O
mother O
's O
ungraciousness O
, O
made O
the O
sense O
of O
what O
they O
owed O
him O
more O
painful O
to O
Elizabeth LOCATION

mind O
; O

she O
would O
, O
at O
times O

have O
given O
anything O
to O

privileged O
to O
tell O
him O
that O
his O
kindness O
was O
neither O
unknown O
nor O
unfelt O
by O
the O
whole O
of O

She O
was O
in O
hopes O
that O
the O
evening O

afford O
some O
opportunity O
of O
bringing O
them O
together O

that O
the O

not O
pass O
away O
without O
enabling O
them O
to O
enter O
into O
something O
more O
of O
conversation O
than O
the O
mere O
ceremonious O
salutation O

Anxious O

uneasy O

the O
period O
which O
passed O
in O
the O
drawing-room O

before O
the O

was O
wearisome O
and O
dull O
to O
a O
degree O
that O
almost O
made O
her O
uncivil O

She O
looked O
forward O
to O
their O
entrance O
as O
the O
point O
on O
which O
all O
her O
chance O
of O
pleasure O
for O
the O

Elizabeth O
made O
no O
attempt O

remained O
quietly O
in O
the O
hall O
, O
till O
she O
and O
Kitty PERSON
were O
out O
of O
sight O
, O
then O
returned O
into O
the O
drawing-room O
. O
Mrs. PERSON
Bennet PERSON
's O
schemes O
for O
this O
day O
were O
ineffectual O
. O
Bingley O
was O
every O
thing O
that O
was O
charming O
, O
except O
the O
professed O
lover O
of O
her O
daughter O
. O
His O
ease O
and O
cheerfulness O
rendered O
him O
a O
most O
agreeable O
addition O
to O
their O
evening O
party O
; O
and O
he O
bore O
with O
the O
ill-judged O
officiousness O
of O
the O
mother O
, O
and O
heard O
all O
her O
silly O
remarks O
with O
a O
forbearance O
and O
command O
of O
countenance O
particularly O
grateful O
to O
the O
daughter O
. O
He O
scarcely O
needed O
an O
invitation O
to O
stay O
supper O
; O
and O
before O
he O
went O
away O
, O
an O
engagement O
was O
formed O
, O
chiefly O
through O
his O
own O
and O
Mrs. PERSON
Bennet PERSON
's O
means O
, O
for O
his O
coming O
next O
morning O
to O
shoot O
with O
her O
husband O
. O
After O
this O
day O
, O
Jane PERSON
said O
no O
more O
of O
her O
indifference O
. O
Not O
a O
word O
passed O
between O
the O
sisters O
concerning O
Bingley LOCATION
; O
but O
Elizabeth PERSON
went O
to O
bed O
in O
the O
happy O
belief O
that O
all O
must O
speedily O
be O
concluded O
, O
unless O
Mr. PERSON
Darcy PERSON
returned O
within O
the O
stated O
time O
. O
Seriously O
, O
however O
, O
she O
felt O
tolerably O
persuaded O
that O
all O
this O
must O
have O
taken O
place O
with O
that O
gentleman O
's O
concurrence O
. O
Bingley O
was O
punctual O
to O
his O
appointment O
; O
and O
he O
and O
Mr. PERSON
Bennet PERSON
spent O
the O
morning O
together O
, O
as O
had O
been O
agreed O
on O
. O
The O
latter O
was O
much O
more O
agreeable O
than O
his O
companion O
expected O
. O
There O
was O
nothing O
of O
presumption O
or O
folly O
in O
Bingley LOCATION
that O
could O
provoke O
his O
ridicule O
, O
or O
disgust O
him O
into O
silence O
; O
and O
he O
was O
more O
communicative O
, O
and O
less O
eccentric O
, O
than O
the O
other O
had O
ever O
seen O
him O
. O
Bingley O
of O
course O
returned O
with O
him O
to O
dinner O
; O
and O
in O
the O
evening O
Mrs. PERSON
Bennet PERSON
's O
invention O
was O
again O
at O
work O
to O
get O
every O
body O
away O
from O
him O
and O
her O
daughter O
. O
Elizabeth O
, O
who O
had O
a O
letter O
to O
write O
, O
went O
into O
the O
breakfast O
room O
for O
that O
purpose O
soon O
after O
tea O
; O
for O
as O
the O
others O
were O
all O
going O
to O
sit O
down O
to O
cards O
, O
she O
could O
not O
be O
wanted O
to O
counteract O
her O
mother O
's O
schemes O
. O
But O
on O
returning O
to O
the O
drawing-room O
, O
when O
her O
letter O
was O
finished O
, O
she O
saw O
, O
to O
her O
infinite O
surprise O
, O
there O
was O
reason O
to O
fear O
that O
her O
mother O
had O
been O
too O
ingenious O
for O
her O
. O
On O
opening O
the O
door O
, O
she O
perceived O
her O
sister O
and O
Bingley ORGANIZATION
standing O
together O
over O
the O
hearth O
, O
as O
if O
engaged O
in O
earnest O
conversation O
; O
and O
had O
this O
led O
to O
no O
suspicion O
, O
the O
faces O
of O
both O
, O
as O
they O
hastily O
turned O
round O
and O
moved O
away O
from O
each O
other O
, O
would O
have O
told O
it O
all O
. O
Their O
situation O
was O
awkward O
enough O
; O
but O
_ O
hers O
_ O
she O
thought O
was O
still O
worse O
. O
Not O
a O
syllable O
was O
uttered O
by O
either O
; O
and O
Elizabeth PERSON
was O
on O
the O
point O
of O
going O
away O
again O
, O
when O
Bingley ORGANIZATION
, O
who O
as O
well O
as O
the O
other O
had O
sat O
down O
, O
suddenly O
rose O
, O
and O
whispering O
a O
few O
words O
to O
her O
sister O
, O
ran O
out O
of O
the O
room O
. O
Jane O
could O
have O
no O
reserves O
from O
Elizabeth LOCATION
, O
where O
confidence O
would O
give O
pleasure O
; O
and O
instantly O
embracing O
her O
, O
acknowledged O
, O
with O
the O
liveliest O
emotion O
, O
that O
she O
was O
the O
happiest O
creature O
in O
the O
world O
. O
'' O
` O

too O
much O
! O
'' O
she O
added O
, O
`` O
by O

do O
not O

it O

Oh O
! O
why O

everybody O
as O
happy O

'' O
Elizabeth O
's O
congratulations O
were O
given O
with O
a O
sincerity O
, O
a O
warmth O
, O
a O
delight O
, O
which O
words O
could O
but O
poorly O
express O
. O
Every O
sentence O
of O
kindness O
was O
a O
fresh O
source O
of O
happiness O
to O
Jane PERSON
. O
But O
she O
would O
not O
allow O
herself O
to O
stay O
with O
her O
sister O
, O
or O
say O
half O
that O
remained O
to O
be O

for O
the O

`` O

She O
then O
hastened O
away O
to O
her O
mother O
, O
who O
had O
purposely O
broken O
up O
the O
card O

and O
was O
sitting O
up O
stairs O
with O
Kitty PERSON

Elizabeth O
, O
who O
was O
left O
by O
herself O

now O
smiled O
at O
the O
rapidity O

ease O
with O

an O
affair O
was O
finally O
settled O

that O
had O
given O

many O

In O
a O
few O
minutes O
she O
was O
joined O
by O
Bingley ORGANIZATION
, O
whose O
conference O
with O
her O
father O
had O
been O
short O
and O
to O
the O
purpose O

`` O

said O
he O
hastily O

opened O
the O
door O

He O
then O
shut O

, O
coming O
up O
to O
her O
, O
claimed O
the O
good O

Elizabeth O
honestly O

heartily O
expressed O
her O
delight O

They O
shook O
hands O
with O
great O
cordiality O

then O
, O

her O

came O
down O

had O
to O

of O
Jane PERSON

perfections O

in O

lover O
, O
Elizabeth PERSON
really O
believed O
all O
his O
expectations O
of O
felicity O
to O
be O
rationally O
founded O

because O
they O
had O
for O
basis O
the O
excellent O

super-excellent O
disposition O
of O

and O
a O
general O
similarity O
of O

taste O
between O
her O

It O
was O
an O
evening O
of O
no O
common O
delight O
to O
them O
all O

the O
satisfaction O
of O
Miss O
Bennet PERSON

gave O
a O
glow O

look O
handsomer O

enough O

when O
Mr. PERSON

at O
supper O

his O
voice O

plainly O
showed O
how O

Not O
a O

passed O
his O
lips O
in O

it O

his O
leave O
